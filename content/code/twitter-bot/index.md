Sometime back in 2017 I used a spare raspberry pi to take photos of the Philly Skyline from my then apartment window. The bot used to take a photo daily at 8 am and 8 pm with the raspberry pi camera module and then tweet the photos to the Twitter account. I think it was going for a month or two until I had to eventually change apartments. I made a timelapse of the skyline (with music and everything!) [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhCg-BfHsJs/) and the now-defunct Twitter account is [here](https://twitter.com/philly_skyline).
