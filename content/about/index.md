At the moment, I am based out of Stockholm, Sweden where I do Cloud, Infra, and DevOps related things for [Volumental](https://volumental.com). I graduated in August 2023 from KTH Royal Institute of Technology with a masters in Software Engineering of Distributed Systems. You can find my thesis [here](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=1&af=%5B%5D&searchType=SIMPLE&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=ayushman+khazanchi&language=en&pid=diva2%3A1801362&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=all&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=6819) and you can find some of the results of the work [here](https://www.featurestore.org/benchmarks) and [here](https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/python-centric-feature-service-with-arrowflight-and-duckdb). Benchmarks from my thesis are also now published as part of a paper titled [The Hopsworks Feature Store for Machine Learning](https://content.hopsworks.ai/hubfs/The_Hopsworks_Feature_Store_for_Machine_Learning.pdf) at SIGMOD '24.

In Sweden, I have previously worked at Hopsworks (Master Thesis), IBM (as part of a selective group of students picked through the IBM Bluesmarts program), and KTH (Teaching Assistant). Before that, I was a Senior Cloud Engineer at Oracle where I worked on the CEGBU Cloud Engineering team on cloud platform and DevOps projects both in Philadelphia (2014-2017) and India (2017-2021). In Oracle, I was also a technical lead for multiple projects across different teams.
