## \#100CitiesFromMemory
I've long wanted to a do #100DaysProject. At the end of March 2020, I was convinced by a friend to start one. I started a writing project that imagined a city from memory as a response to a picture I had taken. I only got to 62 cities ðŸ˜” before it got a bit overwhelming during the Coronavirus-cum-lockdown-cum-pandemic situation. I will return to this soon, though. You can go through the project here.
