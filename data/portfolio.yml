      - name: Electricity Demand Prediction using Serverless Machine Learning
        image: '/images/portfolio/code.jpg'
        link: https://github.com/aykhazanchi/id2223-scalable-ml/tree/master/proj
        description: 'This is a serverless machine learning system built to predict the daily electricity demand in New York, USA. It consists of independent feature, training, and inference pipelines as well as a continuously updating historical record of inference, all conducted using serverless technologies. I presented this project at [PyData Stockholm Meetup on Feb 9, 2023](https://www.meetup.com/pydatastockholm/events/291224301/).'

        description: 'Various different GAMA prototypesbuilt around concepts of distributed agent communication, negotiation, auctions, and resolution based on the GAML simulation language. Picked up the basics of this language within a few days which is quite a feat in itself considering the absolute lack of good documentation around it.'

        description: 'A rapid prototype app that I developed for the ID2207 - Modern Methods of Software Engineering course. The app was an event planner app that depicted certain user and data control flows based around a brief for a Swedish event planning company provided to us during the course. The prototype has functionality for ticket creation and having it pass through the various stages of approval/rejection by each concerned department until completion of the workflow.'

        description: "I've long wanted to a do #100DaysProject. At the end of March 2020, I was convinced by a friend to start one. I started a writing project that imagined a city from memory as a response to a picture I had taken. I only got to 62 cities ðŸ˜” before it got a bit overwhelming during the Coronavirus-cum-lockdown-cum-pandemic situation. I will return to this soon, though. You can go through the project here."

        description: "Sometime back in 2017 I used a spare raspberry pi to take photos of the Philly Skyline from my then apartment window. The bot used to take a photo daily at 8 am and 8 pm with the raspberry pi camera module and then tweet the photos to the Twitter account. I think it was going for a month or two until I had to eventually change apartments. I made a timelapse of the skyline (with music and everything!) here and the now-defunct Twitter account is here."
