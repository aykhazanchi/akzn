      <title>Tiny AES in Python</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently for an Applied Cryptography class at KTH I had to write from scratch an implementation of the AES encryption. AES is a block cypher encryption that operates on blocks of different sizes. I implement AES-128 in ECB mode which takes 16 byte blocks in a matrix of 4 by 4. What follows is a small implementation in Python with some explanations around each AES step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overall-structure-of-aes&#34;&gt;Overall structure of AES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; caption=&#34;A visualization of the AES round function&#34; alt=&#34;A visualization of the AES round function&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;600&#34; src=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/tiny-aes-in-python/images/AES_Rijndael_Round_Function.webp&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AES is quite a big and detailed process. I won’t go into the details of how each round works as that would require a series of posts instead of one post. Maybe in the future I’ll expand on this. Here is the high-level structure of the algorithm that I got from Wikipedia –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial Add Round Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 rounds of –
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sub Bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift Rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix Columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Round Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final round of –
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sub Bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift Rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Round Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular implementation was written to work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.kattis.com/&#34;&gt;Kattis&lt;/a&gt; automated testing so it reads stdin as binary data and outputs the encrypted values to stdout in binary data. It probably won’t be a big change to switch this to standard Hex values for better readability but I haven’t gotten around to doing this since the class ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;formatting-inputs&#34;&gt;Formatting Inputs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functions below help to convert the 16 byte strings into a list and eventually into a matrix. The transpose function is also needed later in the main encryption function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;space_input&lt;/span&gt;(text):
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; Converts a string into 2 character hex list  &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        state &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; []
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; text:

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            text &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; text[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;:]

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                row&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(state[i][j])
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            temp&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(row)    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; temp
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-key-expansion&#34;&gt;Initial Key Expansion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For key expansion, we take the 16 byte key that we have and expand it to 176 bytes. Each of these is then passed into each round of AES as a round key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;rotate_bytes&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;bytes&lt;/span&gt;):

&lt;p&gt;AES is not an easy concept to grasp. It took me a while to understand all the functions and how they relate together. Once I got the overall understanding from referencing many &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kavaliro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AES.pdf&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; and external help the implementation became quite straightforward. This was quite a fun program to write afterwards. The whole code can be found on my Github link below. Due to limitations with Python and Kattis timeouts the program only passes 9/10 Kattis test cases as it runs into memory/timeout limits on Kattis for the last test. It would be fun to implement this in a more low-level programming language like Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Send Pups Chatbot with Twilio and Whatsapp</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/send-pups-chatbot/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/send-pups-chatbot/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime back I built a fun Whatsapp chatbot thing with which you could have some limited interaction. It&amp;rsquo;s not really a full-fledged chatbot to be clear. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a Flask API that sends you a Whatsapp photo of a cute pup along with a somewhat intellectual quote all using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twilio.com/&#34;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Whatsapp API. I won&amp;rsquo;t go over setting up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twilio.com/whatsapp&#34;&gt;Twilio Whatsapp Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;. There are plenty of guides for that around the web and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly basic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The python code runs on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.heroku.com/&#34;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; as a backend API and is fairly simple. It has a &lt;code&gt;/pup&lt;/code&gt; endpoint where the requests come in and get parsed. The parsing is minimal — check if the user has requested what we have or deny it if the request is something we can&amp;rsquo;t fulfill (to make it &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; act like a chatbot). You can see it in action at the end of the post or sign up yourself to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with installing the four main packages we&amp;rsquo;ll need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkdir send-pups
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; send-pups
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;python3 -m venv venv
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;venv/bin/activate
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; $ pip install flask requests twilio gunicorn
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirements file for my python virtualenv contains a bunch of dependencies that get installed automatically. The &lt;code&gt;gunicorn&lt;/code&gt; installation is purely for deployment to Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;certifi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;2019.11.28
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;chardet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;3.0.4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;7.1.1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;1.1.1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;gunicorn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;20.0.4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;idna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;2.9

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;pytz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;2019.3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;2.23.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;six&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;1.14.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;twilio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;6.37.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;urllib3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;1.25.8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Werkzeug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;1.0.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;twilio-whatsapp-sandbox&#34;&gt;Twilio Whatsapp Sandbox&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this works is that Twilio corresponds with our Flask app using a webhook. In the Twilio console you can configure what you want your backend to be and for our purposes it points to my apps Heroku deployment endpoint (which ends in &lt;code&gt;/pup&lt;/code&gt; where the API is accessible). With the webhook configured in Twilio it now knows where to reach the send-pups app. Also in Twilio&amp;rsquo;s console in the Whatsapp Sandbox it gives you a specific number that you need to join. As a user/client you send a specific phrase to the Twilio number which connects your phone to Twilio. Since it&amp;rsquo;s a trial number it&amp;rsquo;s not open to everyone. Once your phone number is connected it can then send messages which end up in the Flask API through the webhook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/image-1024x350.png&#34; alt=&#34;Twilio console with webhook configured&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;flask-api&#34;&gt;Flask API&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flask app is created in &lt;code&gt;send-pups/bot.py&lt;/code&gt; which does all the grunt work of parsing the request that comes in from the Twilio webhook, pulling the photo and quote together, and sending back the response to Twilio which then sends it to Whatsapp through its trial number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; flask &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Flask, request
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; requests
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; twilio.twiml.messaging_response &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; MessagingResponse

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it. I was hoping to make it a little more interactive eventually by adding more granularity to it. You could ask for certain breeds, for example, but it won&amp;rsquo;t really change the functionality of the app that much. What would be interesting is to be able to figure out a way to make the request two-phased where you could request for one thing, send a response, and then &lt;em&gt;based on the user response&lt;/em&gt; send back another response. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t really looked much into that with the somewhat limited functionality of the Whatsapp API so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;deployment&#34;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this deployed on Heroku on a dyno that goes to sleep when not in use so the first request might take some time if it&amp;rsquo;s not been done in a while. The Procfile for Heroku deployment is using a gunicorn server instead of the Flask development server. The guide to setup a heroku deployment is &lt;a href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python?singlepage=true&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The app is deployed/updated with a simple &lt;code&gt;git push heroku master&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;web: gunicorn bot:app
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to play around with send-pups, follow the four-step method to happiness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add +14155238886 to whatsapp contacts. This is the Twilio Sandbox number I received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send &lt;code&gt;join instead-exclaimed&lt;/code&gt; through whatsapp to the above number to sign up to receive intellectual pups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;send pups&lt;/code&gt; to start receiving intellectual pups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieve happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The trial account has a limited free balance that you can use to send and receive messages as part of testing your app. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this going only as long as that balance is available. For production use you need to get your business case approved through Twilio as the Whatsapp API is not open to all just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See it in action -&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hashicorp Vault Approle Auth</title>

      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/hashicorp-vault-approle-auth/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hashicorp &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vaultproject.io/&#34;&gt;vault&lt;/a&gt; has various ways of authentication and since I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with some at work I decided to also put them here for reference. AppRole auth is one of the ways that Vault offers programmatic access to itself for machines/jobs/automation etc. Think Jenkins or Ansible trying to access credentials to run some deploy jobs without requiring someone to pass in the vault token manually. This page details both configuration of AppRole and authentication using vault/curl commands. For the most part the client use-cases tend to be through curl as you may not want to setup vault binaries on all your machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AppRole auth needs to be configured before it can be used for authentication. The steps below assume you have a working vault cluster setup. If not, use the in-memory dev mode for Vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;configuring-approle-auth&#34;&gt;Configuring AppRole Auth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Configuration is usually done by the vault admin or sysadmin as part of initial setup for environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Create a vault auth approle method at path approle/ &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# This is the same as using `vault auth enable approle`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;vault auth &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt; -path&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;approle/ approle
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# If you want to enable at a custom path (say myapproles/), pass it in the path flag&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;vault auth &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt; -path&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;myapproles/ approle
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Verify role is created&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;vault auth list
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;#Path           Type       Accessor                 Description&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;#---- ---- -------- -----------&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Create a role for your application (say, Jenkins)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;vault write auth/myapproles/role/jenkins-role &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;secret_id_ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;10m &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;token_num_uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;token_ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;20m &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;token_max_ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;30m &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;secret_id_num_uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Success! Data written to: auth/myapproles/role/jenkins-role&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Get the role id of the named role you just created&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;vault &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt; auth/myapproles/role/jenkins-role/role-id

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Generate a secret-id against the AppRole&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;vault write -f auth/myapproles/role/jenkins-role/secret-id
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;#secret_id             fccfd62f-361a-eb1b-ad09-00d83c8cef7c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;#secret_id_accessor    060f906a-d972-1030-0165-dcf7f83a85f9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;authentication-via-approle&#34;&gt;Authentication via AppRole&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication via the API (curl) hits the endpoint at &lt;code&gt;auth/&amp;lt;role-name&amp;gt;/login&lt;/code&gt;. This should point to the path where your role is created. The role to which you&amp;rsquo;re authenticating is identified by the &lt;code&gt;role_id&lt;/code&gt; passed in as credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

This can be tested simply by running &lt;code&gt;vault login&lt;/code&gt; command and passing that token when prompted and checking the role assigned to you (&lt;code&gt;token_meta_role_name&lt;/code&gt;) when logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bhrigu Lake Trek</title>

      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/bhrigu-lake-trek/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/bhrigu-lake-trek/images/2019-07-31-11.43.52-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;River stream overlooking Mt Ladakhi as seen on Bhrigu lake trek&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Ladakhi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of July I went on a four-day trek to Bhrigu Lake, an alpine lake at an elevation of 14000 feet above sea level. Since my last trek to &lt;a href=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/the-year-so-far/&#34;&gt;Nag Tibba&lt;/a&gt; in March 2019 I had been wanting to do a slightly longer trek (Nag Tibba is a two-day trek). I also wanted to touch a higher altitude (Nag Tibba goes to ~10k feet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhrigu lake sits at about 6000 feet above Manali and the starting point for the trek, Gulaba &amp;ndash; an hour or so away from Manali &amp;ndash; is the checkpoint for vehicles going to Rohtang Pass. Bhrigu lake is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://indiahikes.com/bhrigu-lake/&#34;&gt;perfect high-altitude trek&lt;/a&gt; for a long weekend and offers something unique. It&amp;rsquo;s a meadow trek that goes well above the tree-line on Day 2 itself. Meadows in general usually take days to get to because of their high altitudes. This also means that there is a higher-than-usual chance of getting altitude sickness on this trek since you&amp;rsquo;re forcing your ascent fast. I went with a friend and we were lucky that our overall group was only 10 people. Because of the small size of the group and everyone&amp;rsquo;s varied background we all ended up forming a close bond over the course of the trek. I&amp;rsquo;ve realized through this experience what people mean when they say small groups are much better for trekking. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more interpersonal interaction between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel this trek was hard in terms of getting tired. The second day is the longest and hardest with a straight 5 km. ascent with little relief. Somehow, though, I did not feel that drained by the end of it. Maybe because I was consciously hydrating myself (my blood-oxygen levels were running slightly low the previous night) or because we took ample small breaks as a group. Maybe it was the beautiful view of Mt. Hanuman Tibba and Mt. Ladakhi towering over us in the background. We were able to cover the longest day in good time regardless and Rola Kholi, the second campsite, was a serene sight with a river stream and snow-capped mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/bhrigu-lake-trek/images/2019-07-31-11.43.57-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;River stream at Roli Kholi campsite on Bhrigu lake trek&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;River Stream at Rola Kholi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were incredibly lucky to have clear, sunny weather on both the long days of our trek and the summit climb in the warm glow of the sun was something else altogether. It was still a bit challenging in some places - at one point we were toe-climbing on a 70 degree incline of snow (wish the picture would do it justice). But these things sometimes seem more daunting than they usually are and this is still considered a moderate level trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the lake there was just a calm and overriding feeling of peace. You sit there in awe that such a thing exists in the most remote corners of the world and that you&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to make it there to witness it. The lake is considered sacred by the locals and legend has it that Maharishi Bhrigu meditated there and with his energy created the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, I think about why I go on these treks. A lot of trekking, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized, comes down to the psychological aspect more than the physical aspect. Of course, you should be fit enough to make it all the way but often the fight against the mind is much larger than the fight against the body. Maybe this is why people climb mountains. It&amp;rsquo;s not so much enjoyment or leisure but the constant test of your own limitations &amp;ndash; physical and mental. At every step you literally have to will yourself into not listening to your mind, which is by then giving you a thousand-and-one reasons to quit. It&amp;rsquo;s a test of what you &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; to be your limits and then going and stretching them anyway. The whole way through you push yourself against your boundaries and with every step you think of a thousand ways to quit and a thousand ways your body aches and yet you carry on. Why? In each step, there is a victory against one&amp;rsquo;s own limitations and doubts. You question your own capabilities constantly but with each breath you take you get ever so close to the top. You end up convincing yourself that there is no path but upwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/bhrigu-lake-trek/images/2019-07-31-11.43.47-1-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bhrigu Lake trekkers walking on snow through a whiteout&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whiteout on Snow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a feeling I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a lot in myself and also others who climb mountains. You think you&amp;rsquo;ll get to the top and proclaim it to the world that you&amp;rsquo;ve made it or do something dramatic or flamboyant but it&amp;rsquo;s almost never like that. You think you&amp;rsquo;ll get to the top and you&amp;rsquo;ll have conquered the mountain and you feel it deserving of a shout from the rooftop of the world. Though this tends to drive people all the way to the top this is almost never the case when they reach there. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that at the summit most people just quiet down. There&amp;rsquo;s no shouting, no extraordinary celebrations, no exhilarated running or exclamation. Instead there&amp;rsquo;s just calm and peace. There is pride in yourself. There is happiness. There are often tears. Deep breaths. Deep gratitude. There is always gratitude. Gratitude to the mountains and gratitude for a tired but healthy body that got you here. You realize at the summit that you never conquer the mountains, you just briefly conquer yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until, of course, you must do it once again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Year, So Far</title>

&lt;p&gt;A mid-year retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the middle of the year it felt like a good time to do a general retrospective on the year so far. The last few months have felt like I&amp;rsquo;m riding a sine wave and I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to figure out a general direction for some things. I wanted to pause and take stock of the year so far. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea when you feel overwhelmed to simply take a step back to catch a breath or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;work&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a new project at work which involved me visiting Melbourne for a few weeks. The work is challenging in that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of room for growth and learning new tools and processes and Melbourne was a really fun city to experience. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get disillusioned by work but I try to remember that there are people that value my work and trust me enough to want to spend all this money on me to send me places on my own to figure stuff out unsupervised! Pretty wild, to be honest. It&amp;rsquo;s good to be reminded every once in a while that your professional responsibility occasionally extends beyond just your own immediate interests. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back in India, the work continues from here and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to learn as much as possible while on this new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the time in Melbourne when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t working (evenings and weekends) I went around eating and drinking and exploring the city. Melbourne is full of art (both street art and museums) and is considered the cultural capital of Australia. It&amp;rsquo;s also a city full of immigrants and massively serious about their coffee and their espresso martinis. The Australian work culture is interesting. For someone who has worked in the US and in India, there is a lot of serious emphasis here on work-life balance and working towards increasing the general quality of life. The US likes to talk about it, India doesn&amp;rsquo;t even talk about it, but Australia (or Melbourne, at least) really seems to follow it. I even had someone tell me the people they were managing had actively rejected promotions and pay-raises so as not to disturb their equilibrium. The biggest thing is that it&amp;rsquo;s not really frowned upon. This is really new for someone coming from the Indian and American context. Oh and everything is super expensive in general because obviously they have a really good healthcare industry and the service industry is well paid. Tipping is not really a practice there, although I did find it prevalent in the touristy parts of the city. All in all, I had some preconceived ideas about Australia that I&amp;rsquo;ve since had to correct and some that were accurate were strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;play&#34;&gt;Play&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a half-year of somewhat surreal experiences. In January, I went down with some friends to Ranthambore National Park over a weekend to see some tigers. We booked as many safaris as we could cover in the weekend (3) while also leaving some time to experience Rajasthani food (mainly Raj Kachori) in the city. We were expecting to see &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; tigers, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; laying around or deep in the jungle somewhere. We were absolutely not expecting to see tigers from up to two or three feet away. We were not expecting to see a tiger stare right at us, drinking water (those muscles!), marking her territory, and casually strolling behind us. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly lucky to spot a tiger, even less to have it walk with you. You&amp;rsquo;re left in awe of the sheer power and grace they exude. We were too lucky and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever experience something like this again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March I climbed the Nag Tibba summit with two friends. The summit is in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand and is part of the lower Himalayan range. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best weekend treks from Delhi and climbs up to a little over 3k meters (~9,900 ft.). It&amp;rsquo;s actually known to be a winter trek but we went at the tail-end of the winter season. Nearer to the summit on the last 2 km stretch we ran into almost knee-deep snow at some places but it was mostly clear up until then. It was an amazing experience and I&amp;rsquo;m already planning my next trek to Bhrigu Lake for the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;service&#34;&gt;Service&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of Feb my dog, Fluffy, was diagnosed with kidney failure. She passed peacefully on June 20th after a long and amazing fight. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a life-changing experience where we&amp;rsquo;ve all scrambled to work through it together with our differing opinions and aching hearts. To say we&amp;rsquo;ve all grown would be putting it mildly. But it is comforting to think that even in her last days she was in good spirits and walking around the house for 2-3 hours a day almost daily. Gratitude and love have taken on new meanings and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to some friends who helped through the process and would inquire about her regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her passing also kind of opened me up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/keeping-count/&#34;&gt;writing again&lt;/a&gt; but it also got me thinking about service again. Teju Cole mentioned in a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://harvardmagazine.com/2019/05/commencement-teju-cole&#34;&gt;commencement speech&lt;/a&gt; the need to use our privilege in service of others. He says, &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip; expertise is not the destination,&amp;rsquo; he cautioned. &amp;lsquo;The destination is freedom. What can we do to free others? Sure, we are experts, but under what ethical pressures does this function? In other words, how do we become a door for others to pass through?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; I like this idea of working towards freedom. Naval Ravikant also echoes this sentiment on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fs.blog/naval-ravikant/&#34;&gt;Knowledge Project podcast&lt;/a&gt; in a way in saying that as he&amp;rsquo;s grown older he wants &lt;em&gt;freedom from&lt;/em&gt; things instead of &lt;em&gt;freedom to&lt;/em&gt; do things. I hope to do more in the line of service this year - either by giving my time or my resources towards things I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;m just grateful that where this year has taken, it has also given. Sometimes you lose someone you love and it feels, momentarily, like the world is a bit darker and you&amp;rsquo;ve lost a companion. But there is also gratitude for the moments you did get to spend together. I think of all the surreal experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had this year and wonder if anything can top the feeling of climbing a mountain, or having a tiger mere feet away from you in all her grace and power, or the feeling of being given responsibility as the true validation that your work does matter and that your opinions do hold weight. It&amp;rsquo;s been a rather eventful and bittersweet half of the year. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping for more and more depth in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keeping Count</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/keeping-count/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_20190621_224218_737-3-819x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Clouds over Heritage City, June 21&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heritage City, June 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a gigantic creative block for a long time. Pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m in the writing dungeons by now. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I even remember the last time I wrote something longer than 250 words that wasn&amp;rsquo;t either an email, documentation on code, or something required for work. Recently though something happened that got me into it again. For the last week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve waded into the waters privately to see how cold and frigid my skills have become. They&amp;rsquo;re rusty, to put it mildly, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. At least not for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dog, Fluffy, passed away on June 20th after a long (and pretty amazing) fight against kidney failure. Early morning while I was sitting by her side observing her physical self for the last time ever it struck me that I needed to start writing again. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why &amp;ndash; my dog has never been my writing muse. In fact I&amp;rsquo;d even go so far as to say writing about my dog has been the hardest of all topics. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to write about her or what she meant to me or what she has taught me or anything really. Never could do it justice. But somehow in that moment as I was looking at her tired and frail form finally at peace after a long fight &amp;ndash; trying to iron it into my memory so I never forget her &amp;ndash; I kept thinking that to write again would be to honor her. After all, we are but stories eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a lot about why I had this thought but I&amp;rsquo;ve not able to figure it out myself. I stopped writing because it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense at the time. The world seemed to be falling apart and &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; an opinion at the time seemed to matter more than being informed. So I took some time away to experience the world without feeling the need to record it. I like writing; I don&amp;rsquo;t have plans to become a full-time writer. I figured if the well had dried up on its own, it would also one day fill up again. It&amp;rsquo;s not filled up at all but somehow it feels right that the time is now. It feels like a way to keep count and keeping count matters in the times we live in now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also time now after a long break to try and understand the dissonance of the times we&amp;rsquo;re living in. Everyday there is something to be outraged about. Everyday there is a new disaster or impending doom or an unexplainable policy. Our virtual communities &amp;ndash; these networks we proclaimed as the social future &amp;ndash; are doing everything to further distance people. It&amp;rsquo;s commonplace enough now that even the preceding statement has become a tiresome bore. I watched in Philly in 2016 as Trump got elected, seemingly out of nowhere. I watched Modi get elected and then re-elected this year with a majority that was either a surprise or wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash; depending on which side you were on. I watch even today as politicians mired in disturbing criminal cases run the highest offices of the country. I watch as debates dissolve into endless shout-fests and the use of terms like &amp;ldquo;libtards&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sickular&amp;rdquo; are considered not only acceptable but pretty much the norm of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe a lot of the dissonance is simply due to the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re so deeply disconnected from the realities of the environment around us and only now are those fault lines coming to surface. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve become wary of people who seem to have all the answers and explanations to current events. I&amp;rsquo;m wary especially of those who seem confident and able to pinpoint entire systems down to one or two or three clever hot-takes. There are core truths, of course, but I don&amp;rsquo;t believe anymore that we&amp;rsquo;re capable of explaining, or even understanding, the social and civic issues splitting our collective fabric while we sit in our internet-connected armchairs far away from where the struggle plays out daily. This world feels too different for anyone to just &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m reading more. Reflecting more. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write again. I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a lot of pictures this year. Recording, reflecting, revising. Channeling my effort in a different direction &amp;ndash; hopefully something more positive than just outrage and hot-takes and endless debates with people who have no skin in the game, so to speak. Trying, at least. This is an attempt to start to put my thoughts down as I try to figure them out. Minimal to no editing or refactoring or filtering on this. Just keeping count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Photographs of atrocity always confront us with questions of inequality. But these questions can no longer simply be reduced to &amp;lsquo;Why them and why not us?&amp;rsquo; If, as Azoulay argues, photography deterritorializes citizenship, then these images accuse, they interrogate and they put us in the same boat with those we are looking at. &amp;lsquo;What have we done,&amp;rsquo; they ask us, &amp;rsquo;to create the conditions in which others, our fellow citizens, undergo these unspeakable experiences?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unhappy UX and Paytm</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/unhappy-ux-and-paytm/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/unhappy-ux-and-paytm/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I returned to India I’d never used Paytm but I’d heard a lot about it. With an overnight &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation&#34;&gt;demonetization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.paytm.com/accepting-payments-from-your-customers-through-paytm-qr-code-is-easier-than-ever-13ed06d8a4ba&#34;&gt;scan-to-pay QR codes&lt;/a&gt; located everywhere, Paytm has become the most recognizable digital payments company in India. It is now a bank, a mall, and a financial service provider. But I struggled with Paytm for over a week trying to figure out how to use the app. This is what the home screen looks like when you first open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids=&amp;ldquo;1801,1802,1806,1807,1808&amp;rdquo; columns=&amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; size=&amp;ldquo;large&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clunky and overwhelming would be an understatement. The home screen scrolls further down quite a bit and is routinely interspersed with ads. There are numerous irrelevant things on it for a first time user. When you sign up the app registers your phone number as your login credential. However, to do any transactions you need to link your bank account which was the first big hurdle I ran into. There’s no prompt for this during sign-up and it’s not immediately evident where to do this. Tapping the standard Android menu icon (three horizontal lines in the top-left) produces a long list of actions for which I don’t have much context. I’d heard you have to “add money” to your Paytm wallet so I tap the first “recharge” option thinking it meant recharging your wallet and that it would prompt me to link a bank before recharging. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t it. I looked around some more but gave up on the app soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came back to it some days later and after a few more attempts finally learned that the bank account setup is reached through the smiley face in the top-right corner which is barely visible with all the other noise in the app. Even going to this profile section reveals a list of actions I have zero knowledge or context about (even today after months of use). One would think Paytm ought to ship a PDF guide to its user alongside the app download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paytm-transactions-or-what-i-like-to-call-the-game-of-where-is-my-money&#34;&gt;Paytm Transactions, or what I like to call the game of &amp;lsquo;Where is My Money?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice now I’ve lost money reloading Paytm through the Uber integration. Reloading PayTM wallet through Uber isn’t stable. This isn’t a network issue — something that is genuinely an issue in India. To book an Uber using Paytm you need a minimum balance in your wallet of Rs 325. When it’s below that Uber offers an integration to help you reload your balance. While doing this the transaction failed for me in the processing stage. This led to the money getting debited from my bank account but not showing up in the Paytm wallet. To Paytm’s credit, they are quick to confirm failed transactions and immediately informed me via text. Once they were able to confirm that the amount had been debited from my account they sent me a confirmation message. However, even though the transaction was confirmed by Paytm, the balance credited in the wallet didn’t reflect the correct amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1794&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;345&amp;rdquo;]&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_20180315_233135_767-544x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image showing a text message with Paytm balance short of Rs. 350&#34;&gt; Paytm balance short of Rs. 350[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To raise this issue I ran into another conundrum. What category does this issue fit in? It’s not in any of the following: &lt;em&gt;Managing my Paytm account&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Recharge and Bill Payments&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;Fund Transfer Issues&lt;/em&gt;. Most surprisingly, it&amp;rsquo;s not even under &lt;em&gt;Adding money to wallet&lt;/em&gt; which is exactly what it&amp;rsquo;s doing (reloading money in your wallet). I found the transaction listed under &lt;em&gt;Payments using Wallet&lt;/em&gt; where there is a separate tab for “Added”. This list seems to be entirely different from the list of transactions located under the &lt;em&gt;Adding money to wallet&lt;/em&gt; option listed above even though from an end-user perspective both are doing the same thing. It doesn’t make sense why half of my transactions for adding money to the Paytm wallet would be in different sections varying on how the money was added (through Paytm vs third-party integration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further I found out that if you run into the peculiar case where your transaction went through successfully but your updated balance is incorrect, there seems to be no way to reach Paytm to correct this. The &amp;ldquo;suggestion&amp;rdquo; I get from their support channel is simply to go back and check my balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids=&amp;ldquo;1796,1797,1810,1798&amp;rdquo; columns=&amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; size=&amp;ldquo;large&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(At least I haven’t figured out their UI enough to know how to do this so if you know please guide me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about such apps offering unhappy and irksome user experiences. I’ve had a similar experience in the past while trying to get a refund from Uber but at least in that case I was dealing with a customer service rep. I don’t even know how to try with Paytm’s preset responses other than to reach out over social media which is far from a viable support option for most people in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, where large swathes of the population are now reliant on digital solutions like Paytm to combat earlier issues of demonetization, financial access, and exclusivity, this messy UX coupled with the hard-to-reach customer support end up isolating the people from the service. The problems of transactions may not be frequent though they &lt;a href=&#34;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/companies/transaction-issues-on-paytm-continue/articleshow/56141117.cms&#34;&gt;exist in numbers&lt;/a&gt; but the overall confusing experience is not &lt;a href=&#34;https://telecomtalk.info/paytm-customer-issue/123126/&#34;&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt;. The person who runs the lunch cafeteria at my workplace at Oracle no longer accepts Paytm. He lost Rs. 1000 in a transaction that showed successful on the customer’s phone but never ended up getting credited to his account. Unable to get his money back or figure out how to raise his issue he stopped accepting Paytm altogether. Who do you go to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion creates room for ambiguity which in turn reduces trust, and trust is arguably the most important criteria for a financial services company. Paytm can maybe afford this inconvenience right now as there is no equal player in the industry as yet. BHIM and Google Tez have nowhere near the same penetration while Whatsapp payments is still in beta. Frustrating experiences such as these that should be easy to resolve for a company like Paytm end up causing a lack of trust in the technology and in digital solutions in general. And a lack of trust in a service where there is high dependency (everyone needs to transfer money) results in customers jumping ship to where they get better service. Or at least products that don&amp;rsquo;t further confuse them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to see Whatsapp payments in action but I&amp;rsquo;ve heard people mention its simplicity. Like BHIM it is built on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cashlessindia.gov.in/upi.html&#34;&gt;Unified Payments Interface (UPI)&lt;/a&gt;[1] so there is also no need for an intermediary &amp;ldquo;wallet&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; money moves directly between accounts. Once Whatsapp payments rolls out country-wide it will become the biggest direct competitor to Paytm simply on the merit of its large user base. Then it will likely come down to which service provides a more intuitive and comfortable experience to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Paytm also has a Paytm BHIM UPI option now which offers a different way to pay than the regular payment option causing further confusion as to why there are two different options on the home screen to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Write small, they say. These fancy sentences will take you nowhere but down. These are the king’s domain and don’t you know, all kings get their heads cut off? You don’t know the times, they say, don’t know the culture. They say, history is written by the collective crowd for it is the loudest. Sway your steps to its rhythm. Slow the pace of your fat pen that knows only to criticize. Arrest your hands from lecherous abandon for what else is it that you write? Lock your rooms of voice and reason well for you may never be allowed to step in again. Speak to no one unless it’s by the collective scripture. History is in the making and remaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summon the strength to listen for it is your only freedom. Listen as if your life depended on it. Listen to record, to preserve, to keep books. Be the accountant to history. Be the ear to the obnoxious beating drum of authority. Keep your artistic license in close and do not reveal it. Do not revel in it either. Your culture persists but you are new again. Carry the weight of balance in your delicate hands and when the time comes pass it on to the rightful heir. You will know one when they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are people born to bear burden. Speak of them highly for they carry your voice, your words, your art, silent and distant, like the sound of rocks ricocheting off a precipice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exit Series - Spaces</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-spaces/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of the spaces we occupy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places like this where I’m sitting amidst palm trees, a clear blue swimming pool, wicker chairs, some lemon water. A small lapse in perception and one could be fooled into thinking one were somewhere exotic. Like Sri Lanka. Or the Maldives. Yet these are only the calamitous ruins of a corporate city dense with dust and populace. A city constantly moving past even its own history. How effortlessly they change its name from Gurgaon to Gurugram, wiping its slate clean. Yet nothing gives here, not even its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of the spaces I occupy —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these places in the mind that serve as escapes. An oasis of respite from the sometimes incomprehensible moorings of daily life. These are not wiped clean by the schemings of any mind. These are where things begin. Most days I move freely in these rooms, bartering questions with a false sense of longing and belonging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am here and yet is there an elsewhere too where things begin?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Observations From a Week in Europe</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/observations-from-a-week-in-europe/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/observations-from-a-week-in-europe/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a week traveling through the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. I wrote this mostly about the little conveniences/inconveniences I&amp;rsquo;ve faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The euro is accepted everywhere (at least in the Schengen area). You can withdraw cash once and use it in multiple countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is practically no immigration from one Schengen country to another which kind of blows my mind. In some countries you have to let the local authorities know you’ve arrived but it’s as easy as walking over the border. I took a train from Brugge, Belgium to Paris, France and walked out of the station. That was it as far as border control goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The convenience of the above two points is severely underestimated sometimes. I feel like this is one of the big advantages of the Eurozone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barely anyone in Amsterdam uses digital payments. It seems to be worse even than the acceptance in India (which may have changed now). Debit with PIN is used in a lot of places (apparently even that has exceptions) but you’re hard pressed to find credit card acceptance. AmEx acceptance is worse, but this is true for most Western European countries from what I’ve heard. I was able to use AmEx in places that were accustomed to heavy tourist traffic like hotels, tourist spots, and Pancakes Amsterdam(!!). France and Belgium were better with card acceptance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traveling in Western Europe is ridiculously convenient without having much of it planned out in advance. In fact, I’d suggest to not plan out everything (have a general idea) because we found a bunch of better/cheaper alternatives in our travels (as opposed to Google Maps) by asking people/ticket offices. As long as your itinerary is flexible by a few hours, you’ll be fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trains and stations all have free WiFi but weirdly don’t have a lot of power outlets. The only exception to this was the first class train we took from Lille to Paris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My phone (Google Pixel) broke during travel and the person who broke it offered to pay for the repairs. Unfortunately, the Pixel, which happens to be Google’s flagship phone, seems to not be recognized anywhere outside the US. I went to three shops in France on day one and multiple others on day two and no one could fix my broken Pixel glass. On the other hand, a guy told me that he could fix the iPhone 7 screen in a few hours. I’m getting a little tired of defending Pixel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless of your thoughts on the iPhone, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized Apple is successful in some ways because they make only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of a thing. If you like to be different from the crowd, this sucks, but the power of ubiquity that Apple has is such that no one knew what the heck I was holding in my hand since it wasn’t an iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another point on above - USB-C is not as ubiquitous as I&amp;rsquo;d assumed. You can get spare cables for Apple&amp;rsquo;s lightning connector at random outlets anywhere but it&amp;rsquo;s not the same for USB-C. A lot of airports still sell micro-USB cables and you would have to have an adapter for those.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designer stores and mass-market labels are literally the same everywhere. Also all fashion seems to just copy itself. You’ll find the same exact shoes in Zara and H&amp;amp;M but with different price/label tags of course. Hard to tell where the trend starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European outlets look ugly imo &lt;img src=&#34;images/dd8f3b0b-2f7d-43f8-b41d-8e69e84c18fb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Exit Series - Cultural Criticism</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-cultural-criticism/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-cultural-criticism/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One Saturday I find myself walking these streets that I have known intimately for almost 3 years now. 17th street leading to Locust leading to 18th to Sansom and eventually to Joseph Fox Books which is where I&amp;rsquo;m headed right now. This is a pretty elongated route to get to the bookstore from my place (I could cut at least 3 blocks). I prefer this way though, because it takes you by the edge of Rittenhouse park and &lt;em&gt;Parc&lt;/em&gt;, a lively French restaurant. I am not looking for anything in particular and I&amp;rsquo;m certainly averse to spending money on another book, but I like browsing the shelves and the desire to not be alone at home on this Saturday morning has propelled me here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bookstore, I am listening in on a conversation between the staff and a prospective customer. They&amp;rsquo;re looking up Hilton Als&amp;rsquo; White Girls to understand what it&amp;rsquo;s about - the girl had inquired about it. &amp;ldquo;Cultural criticism&amp;rdquo; is what a cursory search on the internet brings up and the customer, probably looking for a summer beach-read and entirely dissuaded by the weight of the result, promptly shelves the book. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it but know that &amp;ldquo;cultural criticism&amp;rdquo; barely does justice to the book. I wonder how Hilton Als feels about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I browse through some books on design and art &amp;ndash; genres I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in lately &amp;ndash; but since I didn&amp;rsquo;t come here to buy anything I end up leaving soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exit Series Surprise</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-surprise/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-surprise/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Outside, a thunderstorm has slowly gained momentum and I, unbeknownst to its advances, step out of a bookstore realizing I am not carrying an umbrella. I have been walking the city, examining and observing it. A few blocks down from the bookstore C and I get caught in the storm and I, having a laptop in my bag, run the rest of the way home. I am soaked anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dried and changed I watch the rest of the storm sitting by my window with a hot cup of tea. Of course I&amp;rsquo;m also working on the side. It is from here I witness something I have only seen a handful of times in my life. It is something I always find a little odd, but somehow also peaceful. Outside the rain is pouring steadily downwards. No wind disturbs the flow to create sheets of water. (This happens a lot in Delhi.) However, what&amp;rsquo;s odd and surprising is that there are no clouds and the sun shines undisturbed. I have rarely ever seen it rain like this with clear skies and the sun out while it&amp;rsquo;s raining. When it rains in Delhi, and also when it rains here in Pennsylvania, the sky is almost always some shade of overcast or grey or dark and cloudy. The sun may or may not come out after the rain clouds have dispersed. But pouring rain without any clouds? It seems to me to be extremely rare but to notice it when it happens is a beautiful sight. A welcome surprise on an otherwise wet day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2016 - Numbers and Thoughts</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/2016-numbers-and-thoughts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/2016-numbers-and-thoughts/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall 2016 was a good year for me. Here&amp;rsquo;s some thoughts on stuff that happened and what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was by far the most demanding year I&amp;rsquo;ve had at work. I started the year off with accepting more responsibility (I was made the Team Lead for one our internal products) and that has turned out to be one of the most interesting learning experiences this year. This gave me an interesting glimpse into the organizational side of things and kind of forced me to start looking at the bigger picture of where our team was going. It also helped me improve some of my non-technical, organizational, skills like estimates, scope, and time management. More than anything it forced me to prioritize what I wanted to/had to devote my time towards, especially when it came to communication. Email still sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negative effects of context-switching are something that are often talked about in the developer world. What is it? It&amp;rsquo;s when you&amp;rsquo;re working on one thing and are required to immediately put it aside and work on something else entirely, thereby interrupting the flow you were in. It might be a meeting that&amp;rsquo;s scheduled or it might be your boss asking you to deliver something else first. It happens, and until we get to a point where no manager ever requests you to immediately switch contexts and you never get scheduled for a random middle-of-the-day meeting ever, we&amp;rsquo;re just going to have to get better at it. Taking on more work has put me in a situation where more people need stuff from me. So I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself having to switch focus a lot this year. I&amp;rsquo;m still not great at it but something I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that helps is to make a short list of &amp;lsquo;pending/next items&amp;rsquo; on the task that you&amp;rsquo;re working on before you put it aside. This has helped me get into it faster when I do return to it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the code I wrote this year has been for work but I did start getting into Android near the end of the year so more to follow on that in the coming months. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to have more time this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot of football (soccer) again. I found a group that plays pickup on weekend mornings and I try to go most games. I found this group pretty late in the year (around August) and ended up playing in one of the leagues they had going from September to November. I also played my first sub-zero temperature game so that was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve volunteered a lot more this year, especially teaching kids coding once a week. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is this: being a good teacher, with the right balance of strictness &amp;amp; fun, is really hard. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how quickly you realize this when you start teaching kids. I have a newfound respect for teachers. I&amp;rsquo;m a little unnerved by the amount of access really young kids have to screens but also amazed at how fast they learn how to use tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some interesting interactions with people on really hard and touchy subjects – politics, race, privacy, the role of media vs. citizens etc. Most of these interactions happened in person and the general sentiment has been that the digital platforms we&amp;rsquo;ve built are no longer the grounds for intellectual discussion that we&amp;rsquo;d hoped they&amp;rsquo;d become. I still believe that they can be, but it is up to us to put forth the kind of discussions we want to have. Whether we simply propagate our beliefs or we actually seek to understand is something in our control and no amount of blaming an ecosystem is going to really change that. This is something I get more skeptical about everyday but there is still hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put traveling on a hiatus near the end of the year. I got a little disillusioned and tired of it and I want to take some time to understand what I want out of it before I start again. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to a lot of people about why they travel and the general answer is to experience new cultures but new cultures are also available within a block&amp;rsquo;s distance. And with the current political climate it may actually help to connect with the cultures in our communities. Despite all this I did manage to go to 15 cities, mostly to see friends and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Fun Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly calculated all these off of memory - save for the books which Goodreads tracked &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/5335295&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This has got me wondering if there&amp;rsquo;s an app to easily keep track of this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;height: 246px;&#34; width=&#34;606&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Books I read this year&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Poems I added to a poetry collaboration &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/christutolo&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; and I started last year&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Poems we added in total this year&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;33&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;People I learned something from or had a good time with (caveat: only people I met in person this year and spent at least a few hours with)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cities/places I visited&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Podcast finished (How I Built This, NPR)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;football matches played&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery columns=&amp;ldquo;7&amp;rdquo; ids=&amp;ldquo;1623,1661,1663,1666,1669,1670,1672&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Habits</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/building-habits/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/building-habits/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been really interested in learning about the best models for building and sticking to habits. Part of this is of course stimulated by my own desire to improve and change some of my habits. Over the last five or six years I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to build some habits into my routine to the point that they don&amp;rsquo;t require any effort anymore (reading daily) and miserably failed at some others (working out regularly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my series of learning something new every week (another habit I&amp;rsquo;m trying to build), I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about different models for cultivating better habits/routines. This can apply fairly broadly to anything one wants to implement into their daily routine but in my case it&amp;rsquo;s driven by wanting to be more productive with my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also used a lot of apps and productivity/habit tools and these, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe, are at best support systems and not something you can completely rely on. They&amp;rsquo;re nice to mark a checkbox at the end of the day or keep your &amp;ldquo;habit chain&amp;rdquo; from breaking but they&amp;rsquo;re not actually going to get you to the gym. That part is still on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to a model I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about, particularly because I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself doing something similar naturally. I learned about this model while reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. It boils down essentially to this simple yet revealing diagram drawn by researchers at MIT -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;218&amp;rdquo;]&lt;img src=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/building-habits/images/Habitloop.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt; The Habit Loop[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
Simply put, in order to change habits -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the routine first and foremost
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, what&amp;rsquo;s leading to it, what is the result, how you feel at the end, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a suitable reward for when you perform the right/new/better habit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rewards are like drugs - nice and helpful drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinpoint the triggers (cues) that lead to the old habit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are the instinctive moments/actions/ circumstances etc. that lead you into the old routine. Identify these but don&amp;rsquo;t fight them just yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an alternative plan when those triggers take place
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea is not to remove the trigger but to replace the routine set off by that trigger with a new and better routine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Some Thoughts on Using the iPhone</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/some-thoughts-on-using-the-iphone/</link>

      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/some-thoughts-on-using-the-iphone/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the iPhone 6S for about six months now. I made the switch from a Google Nexus 5 which was, in my opinion, the best Android phone to have come out in its time. With Google better defining and standardizing their material design philosophy it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to switch over to Android. Over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to like the iPhone but I find something still amiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and jot down a few thoughts on where, having switched from Android to iPhone, I found myself frustrated by the Apple experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Screen / App Menu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and foremost is the Home Screen. I&amp;rsquo;ve long favored the separation of the home screen from the app menu in Android. This way, in Android, you can add a bunch of favorite apps to the home screen if you want but also have the option of keeping it entirely app-free. Apple doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow an empty home screen and all my apps are present there whether I want them or not. Sometimes this feels like too much noise as soon as you unlock the phone. If I want to keep just my favorites on the main screen, I have to move all the other apps to the second screen (to the right). This is the way I have it right now but if you don&amp;rsquo;t organize well eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll end up having three home screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Android has a separate App Screen there isn&amp;rsquo;t a &lt;em&gt;pressing&lt;/em&gt; need to create folders on the home screen. I don&amp;rsquo;t like folders at all but one can still do it in Android. The apps on my iPhone&amp;rsquo;s second screen are in folders only because those are junk apps Apple pre-loaded on to the phone and some I use as rarely as once a month. Also because with Apple if you want to create any kind of semblance in your life and maintain your apps only on two screens, you&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably have to create folders. The issue arises when you&amp;rsquo;re switching from one app in a folder to another app in a different folder, which if you&amp;rsquo;re not used to using the home button every time, gets really really awkward. Assuming you start inside the folder, the other app is still three clicks away - one to go back to the home screen, one to open the second folder, one to click on the app. (Four if your app is on the second screen (swipe) inside the folder.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use case for this on Android is simpler. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you start in a folder. One click to home screen, one click to open the menu, scroll to the app, and one click to get in. There is also the hard/soft back button and all apps are in the same hierarchy once you&amp;rsquo;re in the menu. This was not the case in Lollipop, I think, where the menu went from left to right and you had to swipe each time for a new page. Naturally, people complained and it was reverted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deeply miss the back button. Nothing will ever convince me that placing a soft button all the way to the top-left of the screen is a better idea than providing a hard/soft back button on the bottom left. The swipe gesture from the left edge of the screen is awkward as hell when you&amp;rsquo;re too far into the rabbithole and have to go back six pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had some apps (especially the default messaging app) on the iPhone show a notification on the lock screen but once you unlock the phone (not swiping on the app) the notifications disappear and don&amp;rsquo;t show up in the panel. They only show up as the numbers over the icon at that point. Not sure why only some apps do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In iOS, if a notification shows up in the panel but I check the notification by directly going to the app and not tapping on the notification itself the ideal workflow should involve the notification in the panel also disappearing. However, the iPhone continues showing the notification in the panel for something that I&amp;rsquo;ve already checked in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Android if you bypass the notification panel and directly open the app containing the notification the notification in the panel also disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work email account (Exchange) does not ever show notifications either on the lock screen or notifications panel. There is only the notification sound and the vibration and the icon count. No actual notification information. If by chance I get the notification when my phone is unlocked then it shows up as a banner notification for a few seconds but never when it&amp;rsquo;s locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battery has been great on the iPhone. Granted I&amp;rsquo;ve only had it for about six months so it&amp;rsquo;s fairly new but it&amp;rsquo;s been beating my Android by a few hours at least. However, on the flipside, it&amp;rsquo;s also turned off on me at 15 % - 17 % multiple times when I&amp;rsquo;ve refused to turn on Low Power Mode. When it did turn off, it acted as if it was completely drained and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn on at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CalDav / Corporate Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the big reasons why I decided to switch to the iPhone for a while. The corporate sync is seamless in most cases. My work email syncs (despite the notifications), my calendar syncs and allows me to accept/decline meeting invites, and I can watch WebEx presentations from my phone as well (though I don&amp;rsquo;t usually use this). The calendar sync itself is a big plus for me as I can&amp;rsquo;t live without a calendar (I&amp;rsquo;d forget everything). Android dropped CalDav support for some reason and so I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to get my work calendar on to Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exterior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal body of the iPhone is vastly superior to the plastic of the Nexus phones. This is something that has definitely impressed me. The exterior design of the iPhone is amazing, and you can tell the quality apart. In fact, if I switch back to Android finding a phone with a metal body will be pretty high on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gap in Learning Code and Building With Code</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/the-gap-in-learning-code-and-building-with-code/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/the-gap-in-learning-code-and-building-with-code/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: A post about what I feel is missing from &amp;ldquo;learn to code&amp;rdquo; services - one reason why new coders get frustrated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a traditional CS degree. Most people I hang out with at work wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know that right off the bat. If you&amp;rsquo;re a programmer, people assume that you must have a CS degree. Though I did have programming classes in college, none of them were nearly as in-depth as one would expect to get out of a four year college education. (This was also the case for most classes, not just CS.) As a result, most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about programming has been self-taught through building things and taking help from peers and a lot of online resources. The software industry in general is one of the only industries today where everything you need to know to get a job can be found and learned online. It is one of the few fields where people are regularly contributing time and information to provide you the resources you need to get into it yourself. It is likely also - though I don&amp;rsquo;t have the data for this - the only field where industry certifications (not degrees) are not a requirement for most jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because of all this today so many people are willing to try their hand at coding. Having come from the same background (self-taught) this group &amp;ndash; new coders &amp;ndash; is my favorite. The excitement of solving something challenging is never replicated the same way as it is in someone who only a few days ago was a total programming n00b. These people know they like it but they might come across a point where they simply give up. And if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever hung out around new coders you find so many of them inevitably getting disheartened at how it&amp;rsquo;s a seemingly uphill struggle and they&amp;rsquo;re not really sure what&amp;rsquo;s going on anymore or that they spent hours learning the basics of Java but now what? Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s not enough building. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s information overload and suddenly they&amp;rsquo;re overwhelmed. This is interesting to me. Despite all the resources that we have readily available, I find it perplexing that this is a field where even people who know they want to continue with coding end up getting disheartened so frequently. Having played around with a lot of &amp;ldquo;learn to code&amp;rdquo; services that offer tutorials or even, in some cases, a full-scale curriculum to become a programmer, I have some theories on this dissonance new coders encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took three semesters of French in college. The first thing we did in our French class was just rote memorization - words for hello, welcome, good day, how are you, good bye, see you later, etc. We didn&amp;rsquo;t get to animals till like a month later. Didn&amp;rsquo;t get to everyday things like stationary till a month after that. Didn&amp;rsquo;t get to the rules of correct usage till three months in (note: our teacher was using the correct verbiage all along, but didn&amp;rsquo;t bog us down initially with explanations for why it had to be so.) As a result, it never felt like too much information and not once did it feel like what we were learning had no real immediate use. Imagine if one day we were being taught the words and then their multiple tenses and then how those tenses changed in a sentence structure, how those sentences could mean different things with just a few words changed, how this was all important before we even knew what the words really were. It would be so much useless information overload that someone new wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid one of the toys I used to occasionally play with was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://zephyrtoys.com/collections/mechanix&#34;&gt;Mechanix set&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s as close as you can get to teaching a little kid simple engineering skills. It is one of my favorite toys. When you open a Mechanix set manual, it&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what you need to do to build that particular set. Imagine instead giving a kid a Mechanix set and it has three different sized screws and instead of labeling them A, B, C in the manual, it has their exact sizes as referred to in the professional world. Then it goes on to explain why these screws are different sized and what that means, what the different steel plates are actually called, the correct way to hold a screwdriver, the right way to screw something. All of these details, though important in the real world, are useless to a kid who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much knowledge about it initially. All they want to do is build something to play with it, not to understand the physics behind it. And yet this is what happens in most &amp;rsquo;learn to program&amp;rsquo; services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we learn a language we memorize things and only later learn how everything fits. This is very relevant. This is, in fact, how people should learn programming. Instead what ends up happening in programming tutorials is that people just keep learning the sizes of screws, the right way to hold a screwdriver, the multiple tenses and forms of different words - without ever actually being able to apply that knowledge to anything directly relevant to them. I think this is where the real dissonance occurs. When someone realizes that the tutorial they were following just spent a whole weekend teaching them the Javascript language so now they can write a Fibonacci series in the console, no questions asked, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t sure how this helps them build a website, it&amp;rsquo;s not likely that they&amp;rsquo;re going to go around looking for a new tutorial with enthusiasm. It&amp;rsquo;s more likely they&amp;rsquo;ll get bogged down and eventually maybe revisit it again at a later stage (if at all). Not saying all of this isn&amp;rsquo;t important, it is, but this is likely not why the person was interested in programming in the first place. They probably just wanted to see what they could build with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems to me that the problem with a lot of these tutorials is that they teach the rules of the language before telling people what the words are, what they can do, and how they can be used right &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. This is all more important to a beginner than the in-depth stuff. When we learned the French words for hello, good morning, how are you, and good bye we were able to use them immediately. We walked in the next day and everyone said Bonjour instead of Hello. If we&amp;rsquo;d learned the words for cat and dog in the first class, we would have remembered them, sure, but we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with that knowledge. You just need more context to use cat/dog in a sentence. And so, on the first day, it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t directly relevant. Hello was relevant. It could be used immediately. It didn&amp;rsquo;t require knowing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;500&amp;rdquo;]&lt;img src=&#34;images/171.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt; Every new programmer goes through this phase.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time looking for something like this and I think &lt;a href=&#34;http://freecodecamp.com/&#34;&gt;Freecodecamp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://teamtreehouse.com&#34;&gt;Team Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; are the two that tend to come close to what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to articulate. I&amp;rsquo;m not a very good video learner (I like reading more) but every now and then I&amp;rsquo;ve used Treehouse to recall something I&amp;rsquo;d learned earlier. And it helps that a lot of their stuff is very industry relevant (dev tools, etc.) Similarly, Freecodecamp is something that provides just enough knowledge to help you build a project. Their strongest aspect is the near 24/7 online community that is there to help anyone stuck. In both cases, at the end of the day, you&amp;rsquo;re learning to build things before you know how to build things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to paint a room, you learn just enough about painting to get the job done. What kind of brush you need, what kind of paint, how to move the brush. You don&amp;rsquo;t sit through a class of aesthetics and color theory simply to paint a room. This practice of knowing &lt;em&gt;just enough&lt;/em&gt; is what I think can bridge the gap between learning and building, and maybe, just maybe, remove that early dissonance new coders face. If a service is able to master the right balance between imparting knowledge and providing rote instructions to build something interesting, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to provide real value in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Learned in One Week of Zero Carbs</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/what-i-learned-in-one-week-of-zero-carbs/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/what-i-learned-in-one-week-of-zero-carbs/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Monday (Jan. 11th) I decided to quit eating carbs for one week. My first encounter with this was a couple of years ago, sitting on a family friend&amp;rsquo;s couch, reading about Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s diet that propelled him, within a year, to the top rank. All he did was quit gluten completely and found himself getting stronger everyday. Just one change in diet having that big an effect made me a little skeptical but it stuck around in the back of my mind. Leading up to last week, I&amp;rsquo;d been reading a lot about the effects of certain food groups on the body. Carbs just stood out as the one group that a lot of people had reduced and felt noticeable improvements with. Now, I had no obvious reason to quit carbs. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to lose weight. I&amp;rsquo;m generally healthy and I tend to eat healthier, home-cooked food more than eating outside. I just wanted to see how much it really affected my body. One of the only triggers beforehand was that I was frequently tired, not only after a full work day but also many times during it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a lot about how people had reduced their carb intake, anywhere from 100 gm. to 200 gm. a day, and seen noticeable improvements. I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be a pain to keep calculating before each meal how many grams I had left for the day so I decided to go nuclear. For the sake of removing any calculations I decided to do zero carbs for the whole week. Also to ease up on the complexity I focused only on complex-sugar carbs - any kind of breads, pasta, cereal, noodles, rice, sugar, cookies, brownies, dried fruits, etc. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t snack much so most of these weren&amp;rsquo;t a big issue for me. But when you&amp;rsquo;re eating outside at least 4-5 times a week you realize pretty fast how impractical it is to stick to zero carb diets outside your own cooking. To compound that, rice or some kind of bread (roti/paratha/naan) is almost a staple for most Indian meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/carbs-carbs-everywhere.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two days took a little getting used to. I experienced a minor headache the entire day on my first day. I figured it was because of the lesser calories I was now eating so I upped the protein in my breakfast the next day. The headache was a lot less noticeable the second day and completely gone by the third. My eating out is generally restricted to going out for lunch with coworkers and I realized that sticking to a no-carb diet wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to switch out rice for lettuce in my burrito bowls, opt for salad where there was no substitutable option. (I hate lettuce, but oh well.) This was my first real encounter with having to pay attention to how much &amp;ldquo;filler&amp;rdquo; stuff we eat. When you take the rice out of a burrito, for example, it&amp;rsquo;s just a weird looking lump of things awkwardly wrapped inside of a deflating tortilla. (This is just an example, tortillas were forbidden.) Similarly, take any sandwich you can think of and remove the bread. All you&amp;rsquo;re left with is a slice of meat/chicken with some kind of sauce drizzled over it and a bunch of spinach leaves and onions on top. Sounds pretty lame? Yup. The bread makes up at least half the calories of the sandwich. Same situation with any kind of hoagie/cheesesteak/wrap style food. Sushi has rice around it, so do most Indian meals (or at least some kind of bread). Ramen has noodles. Italian is pretty much out the door, unless you only eat meatballs. Same case with most American versions of Mexican and creole food. It took a LOT of creativity and restrictions to be able to buy/makes lunches that had zero carbs. And pair all that with a guy who absolutely could not care less about salads and you have a real situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the struggles, I was able to manage through the week with only once breaking the rule. For Wedneday lunch I caved for a sandwich because I was simply too exhausted of having to explain to the server why I wanted to substitute bread for lettuce wraps. The first few days I was generally hungry even after a meal. I was eating significantly fewer calories, even though I was eating more throughout the day. Still, what I noticed was a significant improvement in general energy levels throughout the day. I suspect this was because carbs tend to exaggerate the afternoon food coma post a heavy lunch. So cutting that out helped quite a bit. It did often get kind of frustrating trying to come up with meals that didn&amp;rsquo;t just default to some kind of grains/noodles. I think this is one of the fundamental reasons why people end up just reducing the carb intake instead of letting it go completely. Also maybe because carbs are just simply delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s practical to cut out carbs completely, but I did have a consistent higher energy level throughout the week. Because I also cut out sugar for the week I noticed that my body wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;crashing&amp;rdquo; from sugar-highs anymore. I could be back from a full day of work and still be productive till midnight or so. I also think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most effective ways to lose weight since you&amp;rsquo;re eating fewer calories with every meal. Cutting out just one aspect of a diet as opposed to overhauling it completely is also easier to stick to. I was pretty conscious about this though - I wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to lose weight so I made sure I ate more small meals through the day to account for the cut in calorie count. That said, I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth it at least once or twice a year to try this and see how your body reacts. I&amp;rsquo;m by no means cutting out carbs completely but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve realized I need to decrease their amount in my diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/687755569311035392&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/687755569311035392&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple of pointers and things that I noticed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was focusing only on eradicating complex-sugar carbs and food products where carbs are the primary ingredient (grains, for example). No specific reason, it&amp;rsquo;s just easier to do. Even Kale has carbs, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the majority/primary ingredient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first two or three days generally take getting used to since your body is expecting more food than you&amp;rsquo;re giving it. You might have a minor headache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you stick to your general meal count, you end up eating fewer calories than you normally would. This is because most of the calorie intake happens through high-carb foods like breads, pasta, tortillas, rice, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; eat a lot more throughout the day as opposed to two or three big meals since all your meals are now smaller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost everything I read mentioned the person losing weight when this was followed for longer periods of time. I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice any weight change in one week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I felt a lot less tired. This is the single-most vivid and biggest change I noticed. Because the amount of calories going in at once decreased I felt that the general tendency of a minor afternoon workplace food-coma also dramatically decreased. I actually went through a whole day feeling active and energetic throughout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a zero carb diet can get expensive - you have no &amp;ldquo;filler&amp;rdquo; foods so your general entrée consumption increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Misadventures in Creativity</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/misadventures-in-creativity/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/misadventures-in-creativity/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as not to be the martyred slave of routine, plan adventure, plan pleasure, plan pandemonium, as you wish; but plan, plan secretly and without respite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/2yndui/text_plan_secretly_and_without_respite_from/&#34;&gt;Full quote&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or two ago I came across this quote in an email and had one of those rare moments where a few words seem to explain vividly a strong characteristic of yours. In this case, it is the simple pleasure of planning. I make plans for everything. Not terribly detailed project-management plans but simple grounded frameworks. If I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of a new project/idea I&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably start breaking it down on paper. Eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll plan out the steps and the details to reach the end. This is just how I think. It&amp;rsquo;s almost a natural habit and I do this for nearly everything - sometimes even grocery shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, despite a lot of things having &lt;a href=&#34;https://axkhazan.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/towards-a-year-of-collaborations/&#34;&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt;, I was also fairly lazy. I got comfortable in a lot of aspects of my life, worked less hard, and generally didn&amp;rsquo;t take on as many new projects as I would have before (in college). I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to think about this. In some ways, I consider it a deserved lazy year, having gotten a job right out of college and having finally slowed down for a bit, but at the same time, I find myself most comfortable when I&amp;rsquo;m busy - doing things, building things, or even just planning things. And also, a year is a &lt;em&gt;really long time&lt;/em&gt; to be lazy and not taking on any new challenges. So I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to think about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did most of the filtering of my thoughts in the weeks leading up to 2016 and into its first week and basically at one point ended up just picking the few broad things I wanted to focus on for this year. This is far from a new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution per se (though I don&amp;rsquo;t know why those get a bad rep*). It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just prioritizing for the year what I want to focus on, what I want to spend time doing, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize over the years is what keeps me happy. On the contrary, I&amp;rsquo;ve also had a lot of time to think about what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to identify where I fall short in the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve started but never completed and what the triggers for those shortcomings were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the the qualities I dislike about myself is the near extreme curiosity that turns into &lt;a href=&#34;https://axkhazan.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/the-semi-serious-proust-questionnaire/&#34;&gt;distractions&lt;/a&gt;. It has ended up in me having a folder named &lt;em&gt;Drafts&lt;/em&gt; on my desktop and countless unfinished code branches languishing abandoned in some kind of git void. This is kind of embarrassing. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s even more embarrassing to announce a project and then have it relegated for eternity in some kind of computer netherworld, never to be seen again. So, disclaimer: I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to all the goals, though I&amp;rsquo;m certainly aiming for that - nights and weekends in full tow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I cannot deny that all of these failed attempts and joyous explorations sparked through distractions have also led me eventually to where I am today - still planing, with an ever shorter list of priorities. Almost like having one less route to test each time you wander. All of those side-roads of deviation from then-current projects allowed me to figure out over time &amp;ndash; and slightly better each day &amp;ndash; as to what it is I really like doing. Wandering does, eventually, bring you home. In my case, though, it did require looking at all the things I&amp;rsquo;d given up on mid-way and somehow accepting that this was stuff I might never return to one day, any day &amp;ndash; so, in a way, a wasted product. Otherwise everything would become a priority and, as a friend used to say, when everything is a priority nothing is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am again planning out my misadventures in creativity. I decided I was going to read 24 books this year which, most &lt;em&gt;readers&lt;/em&gt; would attest, is an awfully low number. But I&amp;rsquo;m trying this year to read better, slower, and a mix of genres. Having all those constraints in place, if I can make it past 24, I&amp;rsquo;ll be more than happy. But two books a month seems to be ideal pace for slow reading. And I&amp;rsquo;m already through with a book and a half. So I seem to be doing okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of reading, another project I want to do is to write a dystopian story. I&amp;rsquo;ve almost never been a fan of dystopian stories because I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to relate to them (I tend towards realism quite a bit). So I figured I&amp;rsquo;d try to write one myself that incorporated a sort of realist dystopia that I would have enjoyed reading. I only have a general vague idea of its rules and landscapes that I&amp;rsquo;ve been tossing around in my head on and off for about two years now and I finally feel like I need to write it now before it escapes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully some of these will iron themselves out before I get distracted by cat videos. But more later on the details for all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve got in mind that I&amp;rsquo;d like to see through to the finish this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*One of the fundamental reasons why I like new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions, whether or not people keep them, is because they offer us a chance to reflect on what we want to achieve and, most importantly, what we believe we can achieve. It is absurd that people hate on such resolutions despite collectively feeling, even believing, that they can be better than their current self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote is from a book on Anarchy. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, but I find it fascinating nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards a Year of Collaborations</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/towards-a-year-of-collaborations/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/towards-a-year-of-collaborations/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of interesting things happened in 2015. I moved into a full-time role, moved into the heart of Philadelphia, experienced what working 12 hour days (though only a handful of times) feels like when you like what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, met some fascinating people, left some people behind, had some eye-opening experiences, learned a lot, read a lot, traveled to a state I least agree with, and reconnected with some old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that sticks out though is an art project started quite spontaneously. In the spur of the moment one day I wrote what was likely the second draft of a poem about a dream I&amp;rsquo;d had in a moleskine notebook and mailed the entire notebook to a close friend. A few weeks later I received the notebook back with a poem on the same theme as my poem. What began was an engaging collaboration of sorts over snail-mail. Now, we&amp;rsquo;ve been mailing each other this notebook over the last few months with new poems. Mostly first or second drafts as a response to or extension of the previous poem. Most of these are not publishable material, of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s the output that matters for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite that, the process is slow, deliberate, and offers us a sort of pause to collect our thoughts. We&amp;rsquo;ve been averaging something close to a poem every two weeks, accommodating for the time the notebook is in transit (crazy, right?). It&amp;rsquo;s part annoying and part fascinating that I have to wait for this thing to physically arrive to me before I can read the new entry in it. It goes fairly against the Internet&amp;rsquo;s steadfast love for speed. And while I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend the snail-mail approach for most collaborations, poetry, though, is a painstakingly slow process, something I still do in longhand today for the first few drafts, and so it allows us the ability to produce slowly but produce something we&amp;rsquo;d be a little more satisfied with than if we were to do it at Internet-speed. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where this is going to go or even how long it progresses. We&amp;rsquo;re only about five poems in at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m seeing though is that the process of collaboration is often one of the best ways to generate interesting art. Feeding off of each other is an effective antidote to any kind of creative block. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be at the pace of snail-mailing each other your work but I&amp;rsquo;ve found, at least personally, that it is often a better work of art when it takes its time, even if it&amp;rsquo;s done online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I really love about this process is that whether it&amp;rsquo;s complete strangers or people you&amp;rsquo;re close with, simply collaborating on something over a period of time can bring people to a deeper understanding of each other - or at least of each other&amp;rsquo;s thought process. As a direct influence of this, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided this year to be open to more collaborations of all sorts, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking for anyone willing to do - quite literally - any kind of creative collaboration on their mind. More often than not the hardest part is simply sticking to the routine as opposed to actually creating art. That part tends to happen pretty easily. So, if you want to do something of this sort, feel free to reach out - stranger or not. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning a City Again</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/learning-a-city-again/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/learning-a-city-again/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids=&amp;ldquo;1127,1128,1129&amp;rdquo; type=&amp;ldquo;slideshow&amp;rdquo; link=&amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was last in Delhi (a little over 2 years ago) I was walking around in the Ballimaran area of Delhi-6. It is chaotic, smelly, extremely overcrowded, and full of delicious food. I was with my cousin and we had overlapping but tangential agendas. Both of us were driven by wanting to get some authentic Delhi-6 street food. I also wanted to explore some old booksellers in Ballimaran and he had to get his glasses made &amp;ndash; which, in that area, is done pretty cheaply and with good enough quality. After having made our way through the many parathas and &lt;em&gt;dahi balle&lt;/em&gt; and the countless kulfis and jalebis, we finally went back to pick up his glasses. The sun was setting and we were there at an opportune time - it was Ramadan and people were about to break their fast. Ballimaran is close to Jama Masjid and so the &lt;em&gt;iftar&lt;/em&gt; preparations there were in full-throttle mode. After a while of retracing our steps to the glasses store (it is easy to get lost there even as a seasoned veteran of those lanes) and narrowly avoiding rickshaws rocketing by, the sun was finally down, the streets were lit up, and people everywhere were offering anyone a seat to join them in breaking their fast together. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that if I would have just walked up to street vendors and asked for food they would have given it for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got to the store, we were told by the owner that he had &amp;lsquo;upgraded&amp;rsquo; the lens in the glasses and put a &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo; one on than the one he had promised, however it was going to cost us a little more. (This seems to happen a lot around here.) We refused, and he nudged a little further all the while bringing the &amp;rsquo;extra&amp;rsquo; cost down slowly until my cousin finally agreed to an amount, both parties only half-satisfied with the negotiations. The owner was talking to us this whole while but what I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed was that when we had walked in he had left his meal midway (the Ramadan fast that he was also breaking) while the rest of his crew continued to eat. And then something interesting happened. After the passionate haggling the owner invited us to join them for food! We were stuffed but it also seemed rude to say no to such a generous offer, and he was more than enthusiastic about the offer, so it never felt like it was being done out formality. Besides, when was the last time a random shopkeeper invited you for a meal out of formality? And that too after having negotiated a price he didn&amp;rsquo;t seem satisfied with? We explained that while he was fixing the glasses we had been eating to our heart&amp;rsquo;s and stomach&amp;rsquo;s content. Eventually, he only let us off after we&amp;rsquo;d each had a &lt;em&gt;dhokla&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has become one of my favorite stories about Delhi-6 and Delhi in general, and now when I travel in the States, something I often think about en route is what it takes to really know a city. To truly understand a place, its people, and culture whether you&amp;rsquo;ve grown up there or just drove in from a thousand miles away. And over time I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly kind of wandered my way into some kind of an answer for it - to know a city one ought to know its markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe you can truly know a place without first having immersed yourself in what I call its &lt;em&gt;grunge.&lt;/em&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s a reason Delhi-6 and its surroundings are attractive - they&amp;rsquo;re the grunge of the city. Not necessarily the &amp;lsquo;dirty&amp;rsquo; but more so the rustic &amp;ndash; the vintage that managed to exist through time. The gritty bylanes where the energy of today meets the resilience of history, where traditions collide and coalesce into something beautiful that lies precariously between a sense of nostalgia and wonder. Where even someone who&amp;rsquo;s grown up in Delhi can walk in and feel momentarily transformed by the air. I have come to believe that it is only after having first witnessed the overwhelming sights, sounds, and smells of a local market of any place do you get to know what it&amp;rsquo;s all about. The beat of the street, the way the people interact, the rhythm of activity that may appear chaotic initially but often has a definite process all end up making the city. And often they&amp;rsquo;re what the city is really about. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder that the &lt;em&gt;bazaars&lt;/em&gt; of Istanbul are famous tourist attractions. As Delhi-6 does for Delhi, the bazaars offer a different personality of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To every city (I use the term &amp;lsquo;city&amp;rsquo; very loosely here but it can be any place) there are at least two sides, if not more. There is the side facing the exterior, the world per se - the tourist pull to the place. Then there is the side that is the city on a daily basis - the daily grind, the hustle, all the things that make up the mundane existence of life there - the city equivalent of the time-space gap between great events in history where seemingly nothing happens. But just as these time gaps in great events are really the catalysts to the great events, these seemingly mundane qualities of a city that contribute to its daily bustle are the hidden gems of visiting any new place for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I left Ballimaran late that evening after gorging on some biryani for dinner, I realized how little I had really known Delhi despite having lived there for most of my life. What I did find in those bustling streets in the company of good food and good people was that it was never too late to get to know a place again. That remains to this day one of my favorite memories from that summer in India.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fragmented Marketplace for Education Information</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/the-fragmented-marketplace-for-education-information/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/the-fragmented-marketplace-for-education-information/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of folks from India have been reaching out to me recently regarding admissions in US universities. Their questions usually have to deal with which universities are good or which programs they need to look for. Most of those who&amp;rsquo;ve reached out to me in the last year or so have been students wishing to continue their graduate studies in the States. I know nothing about graduate admissions. I mean, I do know a few things about graduate admissions but those are mostly based on information from my graduate friends or research on the internet. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Masters so I don&amp;rsquo;t have first-hand personal experience with graduate-level stuff. However, this lack of experience in the person they&amp;rsquo;re seeking help from doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to dissuade people. I suppose the only thing that qualifies me to some extent is that I have done this process (admissions from India, moving, setting up base here, settling here, etc.) before for undergrad. They&amp;rsquo;ll take that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m frequently noticing though is that a lot of these people make the same mistake that I made when I was doing this stuff - they reach out too late. I think the best point of reaching out to someone regarding education abroad is not when you&amp;rsquo;ve applied to universities but when you first start considering an education abroad. What happens in the former case (at least to my experience) is that people have either already applied to universities and thus are limited to discussing their options only in those or they&amp;rsquo;re about to apply to universities and thus won&amp;rsquo;t be easily persuaded to dramatically change their list. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen but sometimes it ought to happen. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of really brilliant people apply to sub-par colleges (low endowment, small state university, infrequent research opportunities, etc.) simply because they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the right resources of information or the time or bandwidth to jump-start their search in the right places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my main point - why is the market for information related to higher education still so fragmented? In a day and age where you can buy toilet paper at the push of a button we still don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have reliable sources of information for colleges and their programs. I&amp;rsquo;ve often had a hard time finding pertinent information about Penn State on their own website, a website with which I&amp;rsquo;ve been well acquainted for over 4 years now. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to find information about degrees, funding, faculty members, cost of tuition, etc. but that barely provides a comprehensive feel of what the experience is going to be like for someone new, let alone someone from a different continent. Students here, despite having their heart set on one university, will visit other universities to get a &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; for the campus, the energy, and the lifestyle. These are all things that matter and often end up mattering more than the quality of a program. This is what people want to know - what is it like to &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; school? Will I get good research opportunities? What are the advantages of a big school vs. a small school? How much money will I be spending? How many people from my country will I find? How much can I rely on the idea that I will fund my education through scholarships? How hard is it to get an assistantship?  There ought to be a way to generate this data or, if it&amp;rsquo;s available, use it on platforms that provide this kind of guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to answer these questions for those who reach out to me but it is often hard to base your experience on only one or two other people&amp;rsquo;s experience. I&amp;rsquo;ve often pointed people to sites like collegeboard.com and others that list out detailed information about universities but numbers don&amp;rsquo;t make up the full picture. Attending school in Massachusetts is quite a ways different than doing the same program in Iowa but there is no way for someone who&amp;rsquo;s never been to either of those states to know that difference, or to even know the extent of that difference. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are people here from other countries who&amp;rsquo;ve had their peers, friends, and/or relatives question them about &amp;rsquo;life&amp;rsquo; in the States. I&amp;rsquo;m certainly getting a lot of requests for information about what life is like and how to proceed forward once you&amp;rsquo;ve decided you want to come to the States. All of this leads me to believe that this field of education-guidance (for lack of a better term) &amp;ndash; of providing information that is more than just numbers &amp;ndash; has a lot of demand and not enough quality supply.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Family Life Akhil Sharma</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/family-life-akhil-sharma/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/family-life-akhil-sharma/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/family_life.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/family_life.jpg?w=200&#34; alt=&#34;Image of book&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you even begin to write about a book that is so painfully honest that it can be tender and heartbreaking in the same sentence. In its most mundane parts. This is the story of Ajay growing up envying his older brother, Birju, in every sense of the word. Once when visiting their grandparents Birju is the one to inform them that their father has sent tickets for the family to emigrate to America. Immediately Ajay is in a state of resentment for not having been the &amp;lsquo;bearer&amp;rsquo; of this good news. Everything Birju does seems flawless and infinitely wise to Ajay. But an event that renders Birju entirely disabled changes their lives forever. It&amp;rsquo;s comforting to put the book in that box - to call it a story of loss and dealing with that loss, but it turns out to be so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot here is simply of time passing. We grow with Ajay and his thoughts. Living with a person with a disability is a full-time job in many cases, one that we don&amp;rsquo;t automatically realize. But what happens when that person is your older brother who you used to envy? What happens when everything you ever wanted &amp;ndash; to be the wiser, cooler, more successful brother &amp;ndash; suddenly come to fruition at a cost you could never imagine? This is as much a coming-of-age story as it is about the burden of responsibility, about what we do for the ones we love. There&amp;rsquo;s a few parts where Ajay talks to God (he&amp;rsquo;s conversing with himself) and we learn that love is not always about blind devotion. That we all have to find our way back to it constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;About what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That after the accident, I was glad I might become an only child.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everybody thinks strange thoughts,&amp;rdquo; God said. &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you think something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I was walking around in the schoolyard and you asked if I would switch places with Birju, I thought, &lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a constant underlying guilt that Ajay &amp;ndash; the narrator &amp;ndash; lives with as he grows with his brother, trying to learn how to love him again. It is so painfully honest. I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered where this capacity to love endlessly come from - where one spends their days caring for their own without any expectation of reward or return. Surely there is a sense of duty here, but in that duty, is there always some form of love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akhil Sharma puts it succinctly through Ajay&amp;rsquo;s lens (and often the other family members who are equally battling their own demons). We find the boy often asking himself why things aren&amp;rsquo;t just normal in his life. Anyone who has spent caring for the disabled, the mentally ill, or even their very old grandparents knows this feeling of wanting to not care for a little while. But we don&amp;rsquo;t like acknowledging this thought, for it is a duty, and acknowledging it would render us weak. We see this time and again in this autobiographical novel - the clash between love and duty on the one hand and on the other the desire to simply walk away from it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most novels that deal with some kind of loss or grief, this isn&amp;rsquo;t some earth-shattering story. This is the sharp pain of a needle-stab that you only feel when it&amp;rsquo;s slowly being extricated. That feeling is already inside all of us, Family Life just manages to make its presence known. It showed me that one can live with loss and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be perfect. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require perfect composition and unconditional love or even eternal devotion. It requires that we come together and strengthen each other when the road gets rocky. It requires that we put aside our &amp;lsquo;strange thoughts&amp;rsquo; and find ways to love again. It shows that love has to be cultivated, and not found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about loss, it&amp;rsquo;s usually about death. I read Wave, where Deraniyagala lost her whole family, and I thought this is what loss is about. But what struck me is that the disability that Birju has is an even more profound kind of loss. He&amp;rsquo;s there, and he&amp;rsquo;s alive, but he&amp;rsquo;s practically in coma and now you have to care for him for the rest of your life. (There&amp;rsquo;s even a point where the mother describes his state as being in a coma, because simply saying he&amp;rsquo;s brain-damaged doesn&amp;rsquo;t elicit as much sympathy in others.) Disability can, at times, be a greater pain to deal with than anything else and we all ought to do more and do better to acknowledge and understand this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not all about grief and loss. There are tender moments of communities helping each other out, of acceptance of our fragile selves, of growing teenagers exploring love, and what it means to be vulnerable. I wanted to pick out a few quotes from this book that show this aspect that despite all odds we still do the routine things - we still want to love and be loved, we still want to find success, and we still oscillate between wanting to be better and wanting to give up. But it&amp;rsquo;s nearly impossible since there are so many little moments like these that I eventually stopped marking them. They are the real gems of this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phone call cost ten cents a minute if made after nine o&amp;rsquo;clock at night. To save money, we spoke every other day. On the days we didn&amp;rsquo;t, I would call her room at nine and hang up after one ring. She would then do the same, and this was how we said we loved each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick it up if you can. This is a book for the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just finished a rather perplexing book. Perplexing in the way that only French things can seem perplexing to those not well versed with the deeper intricacies of the French culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bathroom is about an unnamed narrator in Paris who spends his days living in his bathroom. In his desire to achieve extreme immobility, he goes over the principles behind trying such a thing in different ways. The book is filled with many arguments for such a case, one of which is the narrator trying to understand how best to watch the rainfall. Eventually, he deduces it best to &amp;lsquo;watch&amp;rsquo; the rainfall by looking at rain in two ways - one, by staring at one fixed point and watching all the rain fall through it, and two, by fixing the gaze upon one drop of rain and following it through to its combining with the ground. In all this, Edmondsson (his wife? girlfriend?*) and the two Polish painters in his house (who end up not actually doing any painting but returning later to randomly skin some octopuses in his house?) enable his desire to remain in the bathroom. There is not much more to the overall story except that one day he receives an invite to the Austrian embassy and he realizes that &amp;ldquo;perhaps it was not very healthy, at age twenty-seven going on twenty-nine, to live more or less shut up in a bathtub.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to make of this book. The writing is good, even great at certain parts, but there&amp;rsquo;s a point where the narrator, accompanying his doctor and his doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife to a tennis match, stares into a mirror at his dimly-lit face and asks himself: &amp;ldquo;what was I doing here?&amp;rdquo; There were multiple points in the book where I had the same question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if Edmondsson was the wife or the girlfriend because the narrator at one point refers to her as his wife but the summary on the back cover refers to Edmondsson as his girlfriend. Not sure if this is all an elaborate joke at this point, or that I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get the point of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can You Imagine?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1049&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignleft&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;250&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kalman_principlesofuncertainty2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kalman_principlesofuncertainty2.png?w=194&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a page from Maira Kalman&amp;amp;rsquo;s The Principles of Uncertainty&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Maira Kalman - The Principles of Uncertainty[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine being so alone, so helpless that you&amp;rsquo;re stuck in the middle-divider of a busy road on an electric wheelchair with your batteries bust? I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even picture something like this happening until I saw it happen to someone today. It rattled me a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the time of our lives that we spend on growing and building our community and then we go out alone. On my way back from work I cross a four lane road that, around office rush-hour time, is bumper to bumper traffic. Bad enough that cars frequently spill into the box trying to make it past the traffic lights. There&amp;rsquo;s only about ten seconds of a walk signal on this crossing. It&amp;rsquo;s not bad, can be done easily enough even if all you&amp;rsquo;ve got are jello-legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, though, while walking up to the intersection, I saw an old man on one of those electric wheelchairs stuck in the middle of the road fiddling with the controls on the right handle. Initially I just glanced at him and didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much heed (the limits of our attention, right?). It really only struck me that there was even a problem when I was already halfway through crossing the road and the guy still hadn&amp;rsquo;t moved, was still fiddling with the controls. (There&amp;rsquo;s a fairly decent-sized divider in the middle of the road so he wasn&amp;rsquo;t literally on the road or in danger.) Since I was crossing from the other side, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d cross back and help him out (that darned ten second timer) but when I got to his side there was already a student who, having crossed up to the same point as the old man and mid-way having noticed his immobility, asked him if there was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1048&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignright&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;265&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kalman11.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kalman11.png?w=226&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a page from Maira Kalman&amp;amp;rsquo;s The Principles of Uncertainty&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Maira Kalman - The Principles of Uncertainty[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there was. I watched from the other end &amp;ndash; though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear them over the traffic &amp;ndash; and I saw the old man, obviously feeling embarrassed, denying the offer of help as if it was just a simple thing he could brush off any minute. Like someone just made a mistake and soon things would be fine. Like the wheelchair was just playing games on him. Not a problem. But we drop all our walls when we honestly need, and want, genuine help. I&amp;rsquo;m glad the guy stuck around despite the old man initially declining his offer. He wheeled him over in the next ten second interval as I stood on the other side, the angst-ridden equivalent of helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, safer and what seemed to be a little bit relaxed, the man continued to fiddle with his controls, not acknowledging our presence. We didn&amp;rsquo;t mind. Life is hard enough. We stood around for a while unsure as to the extent of our responsibility. I asked eventually if we could call him a cab, but he refused. The student asked him if he could call someone who could pick him up. He refused. We looked at each other. Was there even someone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually asked if it would work, foolishly hoping for some kind of emergency-battery mechanism or something to prevent exactly these situations. Now searching through the cords for something under the seat, he said it would. Confident, short answers. After a few minutes and a few remarks from the old man that he was fine, and obviously otherwise being of very little help, we decided to leave. What can you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked away a little heartbroken, a little disappointed that for all the money and all our information and all the apps and all the people around on the busiest street in town, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a man home, couldn&amp;rsquo;t get him to safely cross the road with dignity and without fear - without that thought that will now remain etched in his mind as he whizzes around - that someday his wheelchair might run out of juice, a wheel might get caught in a pothole (happened as he was pushed across road) or it might just flat-out breakdown. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s happened before. How else was he so sure it would work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned around after a few steps to check if he was still there but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Half of a Face</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/half-of-a-face/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/half-of-a-face/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this poem last year for a creative writing competition at my university where it eventually won me $100 and the &lt;em&gt;Staff Sergeant Robert J. Miller Poetry Prize (2013).&lt;/em&gt; In the Spring of 2014, it got published in &lt;em&gt;From the Fallout Shelter&lt;/em&gt;, a campus literary magazine. I&amp;rsquo;ve added the judge&amp;rsquo;s critique below for I think it adds to the poem in a way I can&amp;rsquo;t quite explain; however, it must be said that it makes me sound a lot more glorious than I actually am (especially when it comes to writing, definitely when it&amp;rsquo;s poetry). I didn&amp;rsquo;t consciously plan for any of the things that the judge pointed out &amp;ndash; they just happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half of a Face&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
In small bumps and craters&lt;br&gt;
that fingertips dive into,&lt;br&gt;
a rash, porous touch of expression&lt;br&gt;
layered in dismembered membrane,&lt;br&gt;
miniature hills spread uneven, casting&lt;br&gt;
a shadow on dead—occasionally red—cells&lt;br&gt;
stretching nowhere on the surface.&lt;br&gt;
My thoughts permeate the air,&lt;br&gt;
Who would dare make such ghastly art?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A step or two back and the hills&lt;br&gt;
now recede in their reach,&lt;br&gt;
shades of red stretch further beyond,&lt;br&gt;
and more small craters camouflage&lt;br&gt;
into other small craters, till all is one&lt;br&gt;
revolting half of a face, a victim&lt;br&gt;
to an acid attack, an art no more to me&lt;br&gt;
but an ugly truth of our worlds.&lt;br&gt;
The Why burdens our immediate atmosphere,&lt;br&gt;
Chose to speak out against oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voice straining, demanding&lt;br&gt;
to reveal an unbroken strength, a resolve&lt;br&gt;
of thundering magnitude placed carefully&lt;br&gt;
in the space between us, suspended&lt;br&gt;
in the thought of half a face—&lt;br&gt;
nature’s art—rendered lifeless.&lt;br&gt;
Monsters, I think.&lt;br&gt;
Monsters, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge&amp;rsquo;s critique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Half of a Face,&amp;rdquo; a poem about the victim of an acid attack, manages to turn a horrific act into an occasion for contemplation about violence against women and social (in)justice. The poet does not shrink or turn away from seeing and coolly depicting the woman&amp;rsquo;s face with its &amp;ldquo;bumps and craters/ that fingertips dive into,&amp;rdquo; but uses the poem as a vehicle to ask the question &amp;ldquo;Who would dare make such ghastly art?&amp;rdquo; The poet depicts the scarred face of the woman with accuracy and sensitivity, and does so by using landscape as a way to describe what resists plainer description. With an artful touch, the first stanza does not reveal its subject, but withholds this information until halfway through the poem, which encourages rereading and repeated consideration, or &amp;ldquo;re-thinking.&amp;rdquo; This haunting poem, itself an act of &amp;ldquo;speak[ing] out against oppression,&amp;rdquo; closes by &amp;ndash; rightly &amp;ndash; allowing the victim to have the last, undeniable word: &amp;ldquo;Monsters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

      <title>The Weight of Some Books</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/the-weight-of-some-books/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1013&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;1200&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-02-00-06-321.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/2014-11-02-00-06-321.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Principles of Uncertainty, by Maira Kalman&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Principles of Uncertainty, by Maira Kalman[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself picking up a new book without knowing much about it, leafing through the first few pages, maybe even a chapter, and suddenly unable to stop reading? It seldom happens to me to a severe extent. I find that, even given all the availability of time and comfort, I no longer read a book in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, a few weeks ago, having just finished brunch with an old friend, I found myself with cancelled plans on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. So I ventured into a Barnes and Noble, picked up Maira Kalman’s The Principles of Uncertainty, found a plush couch in a coffee bar nearby, and began reading. I started around 2 pm and finished the book by 11 pm that night. Between the first page and the last, I drank entirely too much coffee, changed cafes twice, realized how uncomfortable park benches are, and rode a bus back home. The last time I finished a book in one sitting was a year and a half ago in a campus cafe reading Novecento by Alessandro Baricco. In both cases, I was hooked, though for entirely different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve long felt that the books we truly love are the ones that hold a mirror to ourselves but show us a side of ourselves we weren’t quite able to discern before. Almost like learning who you are through someone else. Even then, Kalman’s work doesn’t tend to fit this simplistic idea. It’s hard to describe this book — if you can even call it that, given it’s equal parts words and art. It’s simply a wonderful journey through Kalman’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart breaks. Someone does and does not go mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?” begins Kalman. As the book proceeds, we’re given a brief history of the extinction of the dodo, informed about the life and fate of various Russian authors (and prominent thinkers), Kalman’s family and their background, about hats, suitcases, and pieces of furniture that Kalman has encountered. This is not, as it may initially seem, some arbitrary collection of information. It is precisely how we encounter life, jumping from thought to thought, place to place, as a means to avoid matters of discomfort, or importance, towards diversions that please us momentarily. Take, for example, the mid-book detour to Paris in order to avoid dealing with philosophy, or more serious and pressing issues such as Nietzsche’s mustache. It is also very funny — something this book does quite well given it tends to discuss war, death, and philosophy, all within a page or two of discussing hats and dodos. It is sometimes incredibly mind-bending realizing how fully aware Kalman is of her environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also, by far, one of the most profound books I’ve read in a long, long while, even with all its deviations and contradictions and thoughtless-thoughts that end up stringing themselves together to form a mirror on our existence. There are questions of life and death, of war, of life in war, and in the gray areas that arise from conflicts between the self and our larger role in the world. At one point, quite clearly irked at having just had a white shirt stained standing somewhere in Tel Aviv, Israel, Kalman poses the question, “Is there room for pettiness during a war?” At another point, she acknowledges that she has “many questions but no patience to think things through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is going forward, and everyone is behind everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finished reading the book, I thought against writing about it, not because I didn’t want to share it with people but mostly because I didn’t think any description I could come up with regards the book would do it any sufficient justice. I finished it, put it aside and, over the next few weeks, occasionally went back to it flicking to a random page and seeing what came up. It was one of these random page-flipping moments that convinced me to write about it. On an otherwise blank white page were two handwritten lines mentioning Freud’s belief that “what we say means something. And must be spoken.” Below it lies a paragraph on Wittgenstein’s humorous counter-belief. but I’ll let you pick up the book for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Just a Little More Comfortable</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/just-a-little-more-comfortable/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/just-a-little-more-comfortable/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was sitting during the commencement waiting for the proceedings to begin I remembered a statement made by one of my professors a few years ago. It was a motivator for us to consciously appreciate the environment we were in during his class and, roughly paraphrased, it was this: Never again, after having graduated from here, will you be able to replicate the environment you&amp;rsquo;re in today, where there are countless others like you, with similar ideas and ambitions, broad and open minds who want to effect changes in the world to make it just a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the one moment when graduation suddenly felt real. You ever feel that it&amp;rsquo;s mostly among the optimists and the dreamers and the do-ers that we, too, feel creative and emboldened? That those who do and discuss larger-than-us ideas make us feel a little more alive? Fill us up a little with a sense of purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be told that numerically such a concentration would be hard to find in the rest of your life is a depressing thought. Couple that with realizing that you&amp;rsquo;re 23 years old and among the oldest few in the room, and all your closest dorm room friends now have to take a flight and a train before they could even knock on your door is a realization too heavy for mid-commencement ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met that professor in my junior year when I took a class on social entrepreneurship that affirmed what I had long felt about myself. I knew then that I wanted to work in the social field somewhere in the long run. What I had lacked until then was the environment where there were others with similar desires and open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right from the start the class was different. The projects mattered because they were real-world projects with real-world consequences and real-world people working on them full-time on some different continent in different countries, and what you did or didn&amp;rsquo;t do during the semester directly affected someone&amp;rsquo;s livelihood. And given that we were working on making our small share of the &amp;lsquo;dent&amp;rsquo; in reducing food wastage (specifically, in Africa), it directly affected someone&amp;rsquo;s survival too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was among the hardest classes I&amp;rsquo;ve taken, not for the number of hours it required but because it challenged us every step of the way to push ourselves beyond our limits. Up until then I had heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;out of the box thinking&amp;rdquo; being tossed around like a ping-pong ball to the extent that it was more likely I&amp;rsquo;d judge someone negatively simply for using that phrase. Semesters would start with professors regurgitating the same phrases, trying to make their classes sound more exciting and, in turn, end up sounding exactly the same. Cue the yawns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, there seemed a buzz in even the most boring classes. Moving on to a new phase of life, I already miss the environment. The late-night debates on world politics while eating cheez-its straight from the box or the unending conversations on how to make the world a better place, there was, in all, a common thread of ambition extending beyond just the self. That to work for something bigger than oneself was not just a good life, it was the essence. This is, for me, one of the reasons I enjoyed college quite a bit in my last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize now that to be able to maintain such a desire requires constant revision of one&amp;rsquo;s own biases &amp;ndash; something one can fall prey to quite easily outside of the company of similar minds. (It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that adults are by far the worst learners. The biases are at their peak.) It is far too easy to blame the &amp;lsquo;system&amp;rsquo; or lose hope in negativity or just sit back in comfort so as not to disrupt the state of things. I find it senseless and devoid of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found people who were willing to discuss bigger things. I found them willing to take on mundane, menial tasks in order to nudge the system just a little. I found passion in people with inspiring and unnerving ambitions, but most importantly I saw that positively working on something, despite their being no fruitful outcome to it, led others to want to help you succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I think about this more and more, wondering what I can do to effect change in my own way now that I&amp;rsquo;ve left this electrifying atmosphere behind, I am reminded of a brilliant point made by the same professor: Let&amp;rsquo;s allow ourselves to rise above the talk and focus simply on making the world just a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
