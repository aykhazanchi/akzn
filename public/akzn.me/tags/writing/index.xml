&lt;p&gt;Heritage City, June 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a gigantic creative block for a long time. Pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m in the writing dungeons by now. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I even remember the last time I wrote something longer than 250 words that wasn&amp;rsquo;t either an email, documentation on code, or something required for work. Recently though something happened that got me into it again. For the last week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve waded into the waters privately to see how cold and frigid my skills have become. They&amp;rsquo;re rusty, to put it mildly, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. At least not for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dog, Fluffy, passed away on June 20th after a long (and pretty amazing) fight against kidney failure. Early morning while I was sitting by her side observing her physical self for the last time ever it struck me that I needed to start writing again. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why &amp;ndash; my dog has never been my writing muse. In fact I&amp;rsquo;d even go so far as to say writing about my dog has been the hardest of all topics. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to write about her or what she meant to me or what she has taught me or anything really. Never could do it justice. But somehow in that moment as I was looking at her tired and frail form finally at peace after a long fight &amp;ndash; trying to iron it into my memory so I never forget her &amp;ndash; I kept thinking that to write again would be to honor her. After all, we are but stories eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a lot about why I had this thought but I&amp;rsquo;ve not able to figure it out myself. I stopped writing because it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense at the time. The world seemed to be falling apart and &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; an opinion at the time seemed to matter more than being informed. So I took some time away to experience the world without feeling the need to record it. I like writing; I don&amp;rsquo;t have plans to become a full-time writer. I figured if the well had dried up on its own, it would also one day fill up again. It&amp;rsquo;s not filled up at all but somehow it feels right that the time is now. It feels like a way to keep count and keeping count matters in the times we live in now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also time now after a long break to try and understand the dissonance of the times we&amp;rsquo;re living in. Everyday there is something to be outraged about. Everyday there is a new disaster or impending doom or an unexplainable policy. Our virtual communities &amp;ndash; these networks we proclaimed as the social future &amp;ndash; are doing everything to further distance people. It&amp;rsquo;s commonplace enough now that even the preceding statement has become a tiresome bore. I watched in Philly in 2016 as Trump got elected, seemingly out of nowhere. I watched Modi get elected and then re-elected this year with a majority that was either a surprise or wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash; depending on which side you were on. I watch even today as politicians mired in disturbing criminal cases run the highest offices of the country. I watch as debates dissolve into endless shout-fests and the use of terms like &amp;ldquo;libtards&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sickular&amp;rdquo; are considered not only acceptable but pretty much the norm of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe a lot of the dissonance is simply due to the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re so deeply disconnected from the realities of the environment around us and only now are those fault lines coming to surface. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve become wary of people who seem to have all the answers and explanations to current events. I&amp;rsquo;m wary especially of those who seem confident and able to pinpoint entire systems down to one or two or three clever hot-takes. There are core truths, of course, but I don&amp;rsquo;t believe anymore that we&amp;rsquo;re capable of explaining, or even understanding, the social and civic issues splitting our collective fabric while we sit in our internet-connected armchairs far away from where the struggle plays out daily. This world feels too different for anyone to just &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m reading more. Reflecting more. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write again. I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a lot of pictures this year. Recording, reflecting, revising. Channeling my effort in a different direction &amp;ndash; hopefully something more positive than just outrage and hot-takes and endless debates with people who have no skin in the game, so to speak. Trying, at least. This is an attempt to start to put my thoughts down as I try to figure them out. Minimal to no editing or refactoring or filtering on this. Just keeping count.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reading - April 2018</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/reading-april-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/reading-april-2018/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collections&lt;/em&gt; is an attempt at keeping a monthly record of the pieces of writing/art/media that I&amp;rsquo;ve found valuable and interesting. More about the series &lt;a href=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/category/collections/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-quest-for-billion-dollar-red/&#34;&gt;// The Quest for the Next Billion Dollar Color&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(World)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;YInMn blue (pronounced YIN-min) is an amalgam of yttrium, indium oxide, and manganese—elements deep within the periodic table that together form something unique. YInMn was the first blue pigment discovered in more than 200 years&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world lacks a great all-around red. Always has. We’ve made do with alternatives that could be toxic or plain gross. The gladiators smeared their faces with mercury-based vermilion. Titian painted with an arsenic-based mineral called realgar. The British army’s red coats were infused with crushed cochineal beetles. For decades, red Lego bricks contained cadmium, a carcinogen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really unexpected and interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ncase.me/trust//&#34;&gt;// The Evolution of Trust&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Art / Tech)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ncase.me/&#34;&gt;Nicky Case&lt;/a&gt; makes some of my favorite interactive pieces on the web. The Evolution of Trust is an interactive game that explores various &amp;ldquo;approaches&amp;rdquo; to trust and cooperation. Beautifully explained, it ended up leaving me with more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thehindu.com/books/i-recognise-the-holiness-of-death-an-interview-with-amy-tan/article23398989.ece&#34;&gt;// I Recognise the Holiness of Death, an Interview with Amy Tan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Social)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There’s the first breath, there’s the last breath, and everything that goes between. What we put in there as people and what we’ve left, what we’ve given. Not these pages in a library. This legacy. I think it’s false to count your symbolic immortality on published books. It has more to do with what you give to the world that lasts forever…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small interview has a lot of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/16/the-silence-the-legacy-of-childhood-trauma&#34;&gt;// The Silence: The Legacy of Childhood Trauma&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Social)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not enough pages in the world to describe what it did to me. The whole planet could be my inkstand and it still wouldn’t be enough. That shit cracked the planet of me in half, threw me completely out of orbit, into the lightless regions of space where life is not possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junot Diaz is in my top 3 favorite writers and the powerful force and beauty of his writing is visible in this unfortunate personal story.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exit Series - Ethos</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-ethos/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Write small, they say. These fancy sentences will take you nowhere but down. These are the king’s domain and don’t you know, all kings get their heads cut off? You don’t know the times, they say, don’t know the culture. They say, history is written by the collective crowd for it is the loudest. Sway your steps to its rhythm. Slow the pace of your fat pen that knows only to criticize. Arrest your hands from lecherous abandon for what else is it that you write? Lock your rooms of voice and reason well for you may never be allowed to step in again. Speak to no one unless it’s by the collective scripture. History is in the making and remaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summon the strength to listen for it is your only freedom. Listen as if your life depended on it. Listen to record, to preserve, to keep books. Be the accountant to history. Be the ear to the obnoxious beating drum of authority. Keep your artistic license in close and do not reveal it. Do not revel in it either. Your culture persists but you are new again. Carry the weight of balance in your delicate hands and when the time comes pass it on to the rightful heir. You will know one when they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are people born to bear burden. Speak of them highly for they carry your voice, your words, your art, silent and distant, like the sound of rocks ricocheting off a precipice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exit Series - Spaces</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-spaces/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-spaces/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of the spaces we occupy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places like this where I’m sitting amidst palm trees, a clear blue swimming pool, wicker chairs, some lemon water. A small lapse in perception and one could be fooled into thinking one were somewhere exotic. Like Sri Lanka. Or the Maldives. Yet these are only the calamitous ruins of a corporate city dense with dust and populace. A city constantly moving past even its own history. How effortlessly they change its name from Gurgaon to Gurugram, wiping its slate clean. Yet nothing gives here, not even its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of the spaces I occupy —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these places in the mind that serve as escapes. An oasis of respite from the sometimes incomprehensible moorings of daily life. These are not wiped clean by the schemings of any mind. These are where things begin. Most days I move freely in these rooms, bartering questions with a false sense of longing and belonging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am here and yet is there an elsewhere too where things begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      <title>Exit Series Surprise</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-surprise/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/exit-series-surprise/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Outside, a thunderstorm has slowly gained momentum and I, unbeknownst to its advances, step out of a bookstore realizing I am not carrying an umbrella. I have been walking the city, examining and observing it. A few blocks down from the bookstore C and I get caught in the storm and I, having a laptop in my bag, run the rest of the way home. I am soaked anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dried and changed I watch the rest of the storm sitting by my window with a hot cup of tea. Of course I&amp;rsquo;m also working on the side. It is from here I witness something I have only seen a handful of times in my life. It is something I always find a little odd, but somehow also peaceful. Outside the rain is pouring steadily downwards. No wind disturbs the flow to create sheets of water. (This happens a lot in Delhi.) However, what&amp;rsquo;s odd and surprising is that there are no clouds and the sun shines undisturbed. I have rarely ever seen it rain like this with clear skies and the sun out while it&amp;rsquo;s raining. When it rains in Delhi, and also when it rains here in Pennsylvania, the sky is almost always some shade of overcast or grey or dark and cloudy. The sun may or may not come out after the rain clouds have dispersed. But pouring rain without any clouds? It seems to me to be extremely rare but to notice it when it happens is a beautiful sight. A welcome surprise on an otherwise wet day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Misadventures in Creativity</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/misadventures-in-creativity/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/misadventures-in-creativity/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as not to be the martyred slave of routine, plan adventure, plan pleasure, plan pandemonium, as you wish; but plan, plan secretly and without respite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/2yndui/text_plan_secretly_and_without_respite_from/&#34;&gt;Full quote&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or two ago I came across this quote in an email and had one of those rare moments where a few words seem to explain vividly a strong characteristic of yours. In this case, it is the simple pleasure of planning. I make plans for everything. Not terribly detailed project-management plans but simple grounded frameworks. If I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of a new project/idea I&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably start breaking it down on paper. Eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll plan out the steps and the details to reach the end. This is just how I think. It&amp;rsquo;s almost a natural habit and I do this for nearly everything - sometimes even grocery shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, despite a lot of things having &lt;a href=&#34;https://axkhazan.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/towards-a-year-of-collaborations/&#34;&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt;, I was also fairly lazy. I got comfortable in a lot of aspects of my life, worked less hard, and generally didn&amp;rsquo;t take on as many new projects as I would have before (in college). I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to think about this. In some ways, I consider it a deserved lazy year, having gotten a job right out of college and having finally slowed down for a bit, but at the same time, I find myself most comfortable when I&amp;rsquo;m busy - doing things, building things, or even just planning things. And also, a year is a &lt;em&gt;really long time&lt;/em&gt; to be lazy and not taking on any new challenges. So I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to think about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did most of the filtering of my thoughts in the weeks leading up to 2016 and into its first week and basically at one point ended up just picking the few broad things I wanted to focus on for this year. This is far from a new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution per se (though I don&amp;rsquo;t know why those get a bad rep*). It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just prioritizing for the year what I want to focus on, what I want to spend time doing, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize over the years is what keeps me happy. On the contrary, I&amp;rsquo;ve also had a lot of time to think about what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to identify where I fall short in the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve started but never completed and what the triggers for those shortcomings were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the the qualities I dislike about myself is the near extreme curiosity that turns into &lt;a href=&#34;https://axkhazan.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/the-semi-serious-proust-questionnaire/&#34;&gt;distractions&lt;/a&gt;. It has ended up in me having a folder named &lt;em&gt;Drafts&lt;/em&gt; on my desktop and countless unfinished code branches languishing abandoned in some kind of git void. This is kind of embarrassing. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s even more embarrassing to announce a project and then have it relegated for eternity in some kind of computer netherworld, never to be seen again. So, disclaimer: I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to all the goals, though I&amp;rsquo;m certainly aiming for that - nights and weekends in full tow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I cannot deny that all of these failed attempts and joyous explorations sparked through distractions have also led me eventually to where I am today - still planing, with an ever shorter list of priorities. Almost like having one less route to test each time you wander. All of those side-roads of deviation from then-current projects allowed me to figure out over time &amp;ndash; and slightly better each day &amp;ndash; as to what it is I really like doing. Wandering does, eventually, bring you home. In my case, though, it did require looking at all the things I&amp;rsquo;d given up on mid-way and somehow accepting that this was stuff I might never return to one day, any day &amp;ndash; so, in a way, a wasted product. Otherwise everything would become a priority and, as a friend used to say, when everything is a priority nothing is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am again planning out my misadventures in creativity. I decided I was going to read 24 books this year which, most &lt;em&gt;readers&lt;/em&gt; would attest, is an awfully low number. But I&amp;rsquo;m trying this year to read better, slower, and a mix of genres. Having all those constraints in place, if I can make it past 24, I&amp;rsquo;ll be more than happy. But two books a month seems to be ideal pace for slow reading. And I&amp;rsquo;m already through with a book and a half. So I seem to be doing okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of reading, another project I want to do is to write a dystopian story. I&amp;rsquo;ve almost never been a fan of dystopian stories because I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to relate to them (I tend towards realism quite a bit). So I figured I&amp;rsquo;d try to write one myself that incorporated a sort of realist dystopia that I would have enjoyed reading. I only have a general vague idea of its rules and landscapes that I&amp;rsquo;ve been tossing around in my head on and off for about two years now and I finally feel like I need to write it now before it escapes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully some of these will iron themselves out before I get distracted by cat videos. But more later on the details for all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve got in mind that I&amp;rsquo;d like to see through to the finish this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*One of the fundamental reasons why I like new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions, whether or not people keep them, is because they offer us a chance to reflect on what we want to achieve and, most importantly, what we believe we can achieve. It is absurd that people hate on such resolutions despite collectively feeling, even believing, that they can be better than their current self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote is from a book on Anarchy. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, but I find it fascinating nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Towards a Year of Collaborations</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/towards-a-year-of-collaborations/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/towards-a-year-of-collaborations/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of interesting things happened in 2015. I moved into a full-time role, moved into the heart of Philadelphia, experienced what working 12 hour days (though only a handful of times) feels like when you like what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, met some fascinating people, left some people behind, had some eye-opening experiences, learned a lot, read a lot, traveled to a state I least agree with, and reconnected with some old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that sticks out though is an art project started quite spontaneously. In the spur of the moment one day I wrote what was likely the second draft of a poem about a dream I&amp;rsquo;d had in a moleskine notebook and mailed the entire notebook to a close friend. A few weeks later I received the notebook back with a poem on the same theme as my poem. What began was an engaging collaboration of sorts over snail-mail. Now, we&amp;rsquo;ve been mailing each other this notebook over the last few months with new poems. Mostly first or second drafts as a response to or extension of the previous poem. Most of these are not publishable material, of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s the output that matters for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite that, the process is slow, deliberate, and offers us a sort of pause to collect our thoughts. We&amp;rsquo;ve been averaging something close to a poem every two weeks, accommodating for the time the notebook is in transit (crazy, right?). It&amp;rsquo;s part annoying and part fascinating that I have to wait for this thing to physically arrive to me before I can read the new entry in it. It goes fairly against the Internet&amp;rsquo;s steadfast love for speed. And while I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend the snail-mail approach for most collaborations, poetry, though, is a painstakingly slow process, something I still do in longhand today for the first few drafts, and so it allows us the ability to produce slowly but produce something we&amp;rsquo;d be a little more satisfied with than if we were to do it at Internet-speed. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where this is going to go or even how long it progresses. We&amp;rsquo;re only about five poems in at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m seeing though is that the process of collaboration is often one of the best ways to generate interesting art. Feeding off of each other is an effective antidote to any kind of creative block. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be at the pace of snail-mailing each other your work but I&amp;rsquo;ve found, at least personally, that it is often a better work of art when it takes its time, even if it&amp;rsquo;s done online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I really love about this process is that whether it&amp;rsquo;s complete strangers or people you&amp;rsquo;re close with, simply collaborating on something over a period of time can bring people to a deeper understanding of each other - or at least of each other&amp;rsquo;s thought process. As a direct influence of this, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided this year to be open to more collaborations of all sorts, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking for anyone willing to do - quite literally - any kind of creative collaboration on their mind. More often than not the hardest part is simply sticking to the routine as opposed to actually creating art. That part tends to happen pretty easily. So, if you want to do something of this sort, feel free to reach out - stranger or not. :)&lt;/p&gt;
