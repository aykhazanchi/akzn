&lt;p&gt;Heritage City, June 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a gigantic creative block for a long time. Pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m in the writing dungeons by now. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I even remember the last time I wrote something longer than 250 words that wasn&amp;rsquo;t either an email, documentation on code, or something required for work. Recently though something happened that got me into it again. For the last week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve waded into the waters privately to see how cold and frigid my skills have become. They&amp;rsquo;re rusty, to put it mildly, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. At least not for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dog, Fluffy, passed away on June 20th after a long (and pretty amazing) fight against kidney failure. Early morning while I was sitting by her side observing her physical self for the last time ever it struck me that I needed to start writing again. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why &amp;ndash; my dog has never been my writing muse. In fact I&amp;rsquo;d even go so far as to say writing about my dog has been the hardest of all topics. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to write about her or what she meant to me or what she has taught me or anything really. Never could do it justice. But somehow in that moment as I was looking at her tired and frail form finally at peace after a long fight &amp;ndash; trying to iron it into my memory so I never forget her &amp;ndash; I kept thinking that to write again would be to honor her. After all, we are but stories eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a lot about why I had this thought but I&amp;rsquo;ve not able to figure it out myself. I stopped writing because it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense at the time. The world seemed to be falling apart and &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; an opinion at the time seemed to matter more than being informed. So I took some time away to experience the world without feeling the need to record it. I like writing; I don&amp;rsquo;t have plans to become a full-time writer. I figured if the well had dried up on its own, it would also one day fill up again. It&amp;rsquo;s not filled up at all but somehow it feels right that the time is now. It feels like a way to keep count and keeping count matters in the times we live in now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also time now after a long break to try and understand the dissonance of the times we&amp;rsquo;re living in. Everyday there is something to be outraged about. Everyday there is a new disaster or impending doom or an unexplainable policy. Our virtual communities &amp;ndash; these networks we proclaimed as the social future &amp;ndash; are doing everything to further distance people. It&amp;rsquo;s commonplace enough now that even the preceding statement has become a tiresome bore. I watched in Philly in 2016 as Trump got elected, seemingly out of nowhere. I watched Modi get elected and then re-elected this year with a majority that was either a surprise or wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash; depending on which side you were on. I watch even today as politicians mired in disturbing criminal cases run the highest offices of the country. I watch as debates dissolve into endless shout-fests and the use of terms like &amp;ldquo;libtards&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sickular&amp;rdquo; are considered not only acceptable but pretty much the norm of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe a lot of the dissonance is simply due to the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re so deeply disconnected from the realities of the environment around us and only now are those fault lines coming to surface. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve become wary of people who seem to have all the answers and explanations to current events. I&amp;rsquo;m wary especially of those who seem confident and able to pinpoint entire systems down to one or two or three clever hot-takes. There are core truths, of course, but I don&amp;rsquo;t believe anymore that we&amp;rsquo;re capable of explaining, or even understanding, the social and civic issues splitting our collective fabric while we sit in our internet-connected armchairs far away from where the struggle plays out daily. This world feels too different for anyone to just &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m reading more. Reflecting more. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write again. I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a lot of pictures this year. Recording, reflecting, revising. Channeling my effort in a different direction &amp;ndash; hopefully something more positive than just outrage and hot-takes and endless debates with people who have no skin in the game, so to speak. Trying, at least. This is an attempt to start to put my thoughts down as I try to figure them out. Minimal to no editing or refactoring or filtering on this. Just keeping count.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unhappy UX and Paytm</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/unhappy-ux-and-paytm/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I returned to India I’d never used Paytm but I’d heard a lot about it. With an overnight &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation&#34;&gt;demonetization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.paytm.com/accepting-payments-from-your-customers-through-paytm-qr-code-is-easier-than-ever-13ed06d8a4ba&#34;&gt;scan-to-pay QR codes&lt;/a&gt; located everywhere, Paytm has become the most recognizable digital payments company in India. It is now a bank, a mall, and a financial service provider. But I struggled with Paytm for over a week trying to figure out how to use the app. This is what the home screen looks like when you first open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids=&amp;ldquo;1801,1802,1806,1807,1808&amp;rdquo; columns=&amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; size=&amp;ldquo;large&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clunky and overwhelming would be an understatement. The home screen scrolls further down quite a bit and is routinely interspersed with ads. There are numerous irrelevant things on it for a first time user. When you sign up the app registers your phone number as your login credential. However, to do any transactions you need to link your bank account which was the first big hurdle I ran into. There’s no prompt for this during sign-up and it’s not immediately evident where to do this. Tapping the standard Android menu icon (three horizontal lines in the top-left) produces a long list of actions for which I don’t have much context. I’d heard you have to “add money” to your Paytm wallet so I tap the first “recharge” option thinking it meant recharging your wallet and that it would prompt me to link a bank before recharging. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t it. I looked around some more but gave up on the app soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came back to it some days later and after a few more attempts finally learned that the bank account setup is reached through the smiley face in the top-right corner which is barely visible with all the other noise in the app. Even going to this profile section reveals a list of actions I have zero knowledge or context about (even today after months of use). One would think Paytm ought to ship a PDF guide to its user alongside the app download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paytm-transactions-or-what-i-like-to-call-the-game-of-where-is-my-money&#34;&gt;Paytm Transactions, or what I like to call the game of &amp;lsquo;Where is My Money?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice now I’ve lost money reloading Paytm through the Uber integration. Reloading PayTM wallet through Uber isn’t stable. This isn’t a network issue — something that is genuinely an issue in India. To book an Uber using Paytm you need a minimum balance in your wallet of Rs 325. When it’s below that Uber offers an integration to help you reload your balance. While doing this the transaction failed for me in the processing stage. This led to the money getting debited from my bank account but not showing up in the Paytm wallet. To Paytm’s credit, they are quick to confirm failed transactions and immediately informed me via text. Once they were able to confirm that the amount had been debited from my account they sent me a confirmation message. However, even though the transaction was confirmed by Paytm, the balance credited in the wallet didn’t reflect the correct amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1794&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;345&amp;rdquo;]&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_20180315_233135_767-544x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image showing a text message with Paytm balance short of Rs. 350&#34;&gt; Paytm balance short of Rs. 350[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To raise this issue I ran into another conundrum. What category does this issue fit in? It’s not in any of the following: &lt;em&gt;Managing my Paytm account&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Recharge and Bill Payments&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;Fund Transfer Issues&lt;/em&gt;. Most surprisingly, it&amp;rsquo;s not even under &lt;em&gt;Adding money to wallet&lt;/em&gt; which is exactly what it&amp;rsquo;s doing (reloading money in your wallet). I found the transaction listed under &lt;em&gt;Payments using Wallet&lt;/em&gt; where there is a separate tab for “Added”. This list seems to be entirely different from the list of transactions located under the &lt;em&gt;Adding money to wallet&lt;/em&gt; option listed above even though from an end-user perspective both are doing the same thing. It doesn’t make sense why half of my transactions for adding money to the Paytm wallet would be in different sections varying on how the money was added (through Paytm vs third-party integration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further I found out that if you run into the peculiar case where your transaction went through successfully but your updated balance is incorrect, there seems to be no way to reach Paytm to correct this. The &amp;ldquo;suggestion&amp;rdquo; I get from their support channel is simply to go back and check my balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids=&amp;ldquo;1796,1797,1810,1798&amp;rdquo; columns=&amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; size=&amp;ldquo;large&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(At least I haven’t figured out their UI enough to know how to do this so if you know please guide me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about such apps offering unhappy and irksome user experiences. I’ve had a similar experience in the past while trying to get a refund from Uber but at least in that case I was dealing with a customer service rep. I don’t even know how to try with Paytm’s preset responses other than to reach out over social media which is far from a viable support option for most people in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, where large swathes of the population are now reliant on digital solutions like Paytm to combat earlier issues of demonetization, financial access, and exclusivity, this messy UX coupled with the hard-to-reach customer support end up isolating the people from the service. The problems of transactions may not be frequent though they &lt;a href=&#34;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/companies/transaction-issues-on-paytm-continue/articleshow/56141117.cms&#34;&gt;exist in numbers&lt;/a&gt; but the overall confusing experience is not &lt;a href=&#34;https://telecomtalk.info/paytm-customer-issue/123126/&#34;&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt;. The person who runs the lunch cafeteria at my workplace at Oracle no longer accepts Paytm. He lost Rs. 1000 in a transaction that showed successful on the customer’s phone but never ended up getting credited to his account. Unable to get his money back or figure out how to raise his issue he stopped accepting Paytm altogether. Who do you go to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion creates room for ambiguity which in turn reduces trust, and trust is arguably the most important criteria for a financial services company. Paytm can maybe afford this inconvenience right now as there is no equal player in the industry as yet. BHIM and Google Tez have nowhere near the same penetration while Whatsapp payments is still in beta. Frustrating experiences such as these that should be easy to resolve for a company like Paytm end up causing a lack of trust in the technology and in digital solutions in general. And a lack of trust in a service where there is high dependency (everyone needs to transfer money) results in customers jumping ship to where they get better service. Or at least products that don&amp;rsquo;t further confuse them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to see Whatsapp payments in action but I&amp;rsquo;ve heard people mention its simplicity. Like BHIM it is built on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cashlessindia.gov.in/upi.html&#34;&gt;Unified Payments Interface (UPI)&lt;/a&gt;[1] so there is also no need for an intermediary &amp;ldquo;wallet&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; money moves directly between accounts. Once Whatsapp payments rolls out country-wide it will become the biggest direct competitor to Paytm simply on the merit of its large user base. Then it will likely come down to which service provides a more intuitive and comfortable experience to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Paytm also has a Paytm BHIM UPI option now which offers a different way to pay than the regular payment option causing further confusion as to why there are two different options on the home screen to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fragmented Marketplace for Education Information</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/the-fragmented-marketplace-for-education-information/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/the-fragmented-marketplace-for-education-information/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of folks from India have been reaching out to me recently regarding admissions in US universities. Their questions usually have to deal with which universities are good or which programs they need to look for. Most of those who&amp;rsquo;ve reached out to me in the last year or so have been students wishing to continue their graduate studies in the States. I know nothing about graduate admissions. I mean, I do know a few things about graduate admissions but those are mostly based on information from my graduate friends or research on the internet. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Masters so I don&amp;rsquo;t have first-hand personal experience with graduate-level stuff. However, this lack of experience in the person they&amp;rsquo;re seeking help from doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to dissuade people. I suppose the only thing that qualifies me to some extent is that I have done this process (admissions from India, moving, setting up base here, settling here, etc.) before for undergrad. They&amp;rsquo;ll take that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m frequently noticing though is that a lot of these people make the same mistake that I made when I was doing this stuff - they reach out too late. I think the best point of reaching out to someone regarding education abroad is not when you&amp;rsquo;ve applied to universities but when you first start considering an education abroad. What happens in the former case (at least to my experience) is that people have either already applied to universities and thus are limited to discussing their options only in those or they&amp;rsquo;re about to apply to universities and thus won&amp;rsquo;t be easily persuaded to dramatically change their list. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen but sometimes it ought to happen. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of really brilliant people apply to sub-par colleges (low endowment, small state university, infrequent research opportunities, etc.) simply because they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the right resources of information or the time or bandwidth to jump-start their search in the right places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my main point - why is the market for information related to higher education still so fragmented? In a day and age where you can buy toilet paper at the push of a button we still don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have reliable sources of information for colleges and their programs. I&amp;rsquo;ve often had a hard time finding pertinent information about Penn State on their own website, a website with which I&amp;rsquo;ve been well acquainted for over 4 years now. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to find information about degrees, funding, faculty members, cost of tuition, etc. but that barely provides a comprehensive feel of what the experience is going to be like for someone new, let alone someone from a different continent. Students here, despite having their heart set on one university, will visit other universities to get a &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; for the campus, the energy, and the lifestyle. These are all things that matter and often end up mattering more than the quality of a program. This is what people want to know - what is it like to &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; school? Will I get good research opportunities? What are the advantages of a big school vs. a small school? How much money will I be spending? How many people from my country will I find? How much can I rely on the idea that I will fund my education through scholarships? How hard is it to get an assistantship?  There ought to be a way to generate this data or, if it&amp;rsquo;s available, use it on platforms that provide this kind of guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to answer these questions for those who reach out to me but it is often hard to base your experience on only one or two other people&amp;rsquo;s experience. I&amp;rsquo;ve often pointed people to sites like collegeboard.com and others that list out detailed information about universities but numbers don&amp;rsquo;t make up the full picture. Attending school in Massachusetts is quite a ways different than doing the same program in Iowa but there is no way for someone who&amp;rsquo;s never been to either of those states to know that difference, or to even know the extent of that difference. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are people here from other countries who&amp;rsquo;ve had their peers, friends, and/or relatives question them about &amp;rsquo;life&amp;rsquo; in the States. I&amp;rsquo;m certainly getting a lot of requests for information about what life is like and how to proceed forward once you&amp;rsquo;ve decided you want to come to the States. All of this leads me to believe that this field of education-guidance (for lack of a better term) &amp;ndash; of providing information that is more than just numbers &amp;ndash; has a lot of demand and not enough quality supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
