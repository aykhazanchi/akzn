&lt;p&gt;The world lacks a great all-around red. Always has. We’ve made do with alternatives that could be toxic or plain gross. The gladiators smeared their faces with mercury-based vermilion.

      <title>Exit Series - Ethos</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Write small, they say. These fancy sentences will take you nowhere but down. These are the king’s domain and don’t you know, all kings get their heads cut off? You don’t know the times, they say, don’t know the culture. They say, history is written by the collective crowd for it is the loudest. Sway your steps to its rhythm. Slow the pace of your fat pen that knows only to criticize. Arrest your hands from lecherous abandon for what else is it that you write? Lock your rooms of voice and reason well for you may never be allowed to step in again. Speak to no one unless it’s by the collective scripture. History is in the making and remaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summon the strength to listen for it is your only freedom. Listen as if your life depended on it. Listen to record, to preserve, to keep books. Be the accountant to history. Be the ear to the obnoxious beating drum of authority. Keep your artistic license in close and do not reveal it. Do not revel in it either. Your culture persists but you are new again. Carry the weight of balance in your delicate hands and when the time comes pass it on to the rightful heir. You will know one when they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are people born to bear burden. Speak of them highly for they carry your voice, your words, your art, silent and distant, like the sound of rocks ricocheting off a precipice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Misadventures in Creativity</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/misadventures-in-creativity/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/misadventures-in-creativity/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as not to be the martyred slave of routine, plan adventure, plan pleasure, plan pandemonium, as you wish; but plan, plan secretly and without respite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/2yndui/text_plan_secretly_and_without_respite_from/&#34;&gt;Full quote&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or two ago I came across this quote in an email and had one of those rare moments where a few words seem to explain vividly a strong characteristic of yours. In this case, it is the simple pleasure of planning. I make plans for everything. Not terribly detailed project-management plans but simple grounded frameworks. If I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of a new project/idea I&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably start breaking it down on paper. Eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll plan out the steps and the details to reach the end. This is just how I think. It&amp;rsquo;s almost a natural habit and I do this for nearly everything - sometimes even grocery shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, despite a lot of things having &lt;a href=&#34;https://axkhazan.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/towards-a-year-of-collaborations/&#34;&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt;, I was also fairly lazy. I got comfortable in a lot of aspects of my life, worked less hard, and generally didn&amp;rsquo;t take on as many new projects as I would have before (in college). I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to think about this. In some ways, I consider it a deserved lazy year, having gotten a job right out of college and having finally slowed down for a bit, but at the same time, I find myself most comfortable when I&amp;rsquo;m busy - doing things, building things, or even just planning things. And also, a year is a &lt;em&gt;really long time&lt;/em&gt; to be lazy and not taking on any new challenges. So I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to think about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did most of the filtering of my thoughts in the weeks leading up to 2016 and into its first week and basically at one point ended up just picking the few broad things I wanted to focus on for this year. This is far from a new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution per se (though I don&amp;rsquo;t know why those get a bad rep*). It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just prioritizing for the year what I want to focus on, what I want to spend time doing, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize over the years is what keeps me happy. On the contrary, I&amp;rsquo;ve also had a lot of time to think about what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to identify where I fall short in the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve started but never completed and what the triggers for those shortcomings were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the the qualities I dislike about myself is the near extreme curiosity that turns into &lt;a href=&#34;https://axkhazan.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/the-semi-serious-proust-questionnaire/&#34;&gt;distractions&lt;/a&gt;. It has ended up in me having a folder named &lt;em&gt;Drafts&lt;/em&gt; on my desktop and countless unfinished code branches languishing abandoned in some kind of git void. This is kind of embarrassing. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s even more embarrassing to announce a project and then have it relegated for eternity in some kind of computer netherworld, never to be seen again. So, disclaimer: I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to all the goals, though I&amp;rsquo;m certainly aiming for that - nights and weekends in full tow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I cannot deny that all of these failed attempts and joyous explorations sparked through distractions have also led me eventually to where I am today - still planing, with an ever shorter list of priorities. Almost like having one less route to test each time you wander. All of those side-roads of deviation from then-current projects allowed me to figure out over time &amp;ndash; and slightly better each day &amp;ndash; as to what it is I really like doing. Wandering does, eventually, bring you home. In my case, though, it did require looking at all the things I&amp;rsquo;d given up on mid-way and somehow accepting that this was stuff I might never return to one day, any day &amp;ndash; so, in a way, a wasted product. Otherwise everything would become a priority and, as a friend used to say, when everything is a priority nothing is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am again planning out my misadventures in creativity. I decided I was going to read 24 books this year which, most &lt;em&gt;readers&lt;/em&gt; would attest, is an awfully low number. But I&amp;rsquo;m trying this year to read better, slower, and a mix of genres. Having all those constraints in place, if I can make it past 24, I&amp;rsquo;ll be more than happy. But two books a month seems to be ideal pace for slow reading. And I&amp;rsquo;m already through with a book and a half. So I seem to be doing okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of reading, another project I want to do is to write a dystopian story. I&amp;rsquo;ve almost never been a fan of dystopian stories because I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to relate to them (I tend towards realism quite a bit). So I figured I&amp;rsquo;d try to write one myself that incorporated a sort of realist dystopia that I would have enjoyed reading. I only have a general vague idea of its rules and landscapes that I&amp;rsquo;ve been tossing around in my head on and off for about two years now and I finally feel like I need to write it now before it escapes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully some of these will iron themselves out before I get distracted by cat videos. But more later on the details for all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve got in mind that I&amp;rsquo;d like to see through to the finish this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*One of the fundamental reasons why I like new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions, whether or not people keep them, is because they offer us a chance to reflect on what we want to achieve and, most importantly, what we believe we can achieve. It is absurd that people hate on such resolutions despite collectively feeling, even believing, that they can be better than their current self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote is from a book on Anarchy. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, but I find it fascinating nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards a Year of Collaborations</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/towards-a-year-of-collaborations/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/towards-a-year-of-collaborations/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of interesting things happened in 2015. I moved into a full-time role, moved into the heart of Philadelphia, experienced what working 12 hour days (though only a handful of times) feels like when you like what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, met some fascinating people, left some people behind, had some eye-opening experiences, learned a lot, read a lot, traveled to a state I least agree with, and reconnected with some old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that sticks out though is an art project started quite spontaneously. In the spur of the moment one day I wrote what was likely the second draft of a poem about a dream I&amp;rsquo;d had in a moleskine notebook and mailed the entire notebook to a close friend. A few weeks later I received the notebook back with a poem on the same theme as my poem. What began was an engaging collaboration of sorts over snail-mail. Now, we&amp;rsquo;ve been mailing each other this notebook over the last few months with new poems. Mostly first or second drafts as a response to or extension of the previous poem. Most of these are not publishable material, of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s the output that matters for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite that, the process is slow, deliberate, and offers us a sort of pause to collect our thoughts. We&amp;rsquo;ve been averaging something close to a poem every two weeks, accommodating for the time the notebook is in transit (crazy, right?). It&amp;rsquo;s part annoying and part fascinating that I have to wait for this thing to physically arrive to me before I can read the new entry in it. It goes fairly against the Internet&amp;rsquo;s steadfast love for speed. And while I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend the snail-mail approach for most collaborations, poetry, though, is a painstakingly slow process, something I still do in longhand today for the first few drafts, and so it allows us the ability to produce slowly but produce something we&amp;rsquo;d be a little more satisfied with than if we were to do it at Internet-speed. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where this is going to go or even how long it progresses. We&amp;rsquo;re only about five poems in at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m seeing though is that the process of collaboration is often one of the best ways to generate interesting art. Feeding off of each other is an effective antidote to any kind of creative block. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be at the pace of snail-mailing each other your work but I&amp;rsquo;ve found, at least personally, that it is often a better work of art when it takes its time, even if it&amp;rsquo;s done online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I really love about this process is that whether it&amp;rsquo;s complete strangers or people you&amp;rsquo;re close with, simply collaborating on something over a period of time can bring people to a deeper understanding of each other - or at least of each other&amp;rsquo;s thought process. As a direct influence of this, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided this year to be open to more collaborations of all sorts, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking for anyone willing to do - quite literally - any kind of creative collaboration on their mind. More often than not the hardest part is simply sticking to the routine as opposed to actually creating art. That part tends to happen pretty easily. So, if you want to do something of this sort, feel free to reach out - stranger or not. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Weight of Some Books</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/the-weight-of-some-books/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/the-weight-of-some-books/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1013&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;1200&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-02-00-06-321.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/2014-11-02-00-06-321.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Principles of Uncertainty, by Maira Kalman&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Principles of Uncertainty, by Maira Kalman[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself picking up a new book without knowing much about it, leafing through the first few pages, maybe even a chapter, and suddenly unable to stop reading? It seldom happens to me to a severe extent. I find that, even given all the availability of time and comfort, I no longer read a book in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, a few weeks ago, having just finished brunch with an old friend, I found myself with cancelled plans on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. So I ventured into a Barnes and Noble, picked up Maira Kalman’s The Principles of Uncertainty, found a plush couch in a coffee bar nearby, and began reading. I started around 2 pm and finished the book by 11 pm that night. Between the first page and the last, I drank entirely too much coffee, changed cafes twice, realized how uncomfortable park benches are, and rode a bus back home. The last time I finished a book in one sitting was a year and a half ago in a campus cafe reading Novecento by Alessandro Baricco. In both cases, I was hooked, though for entirely different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve long felt that the books we truly love are the ones that hold a mirror to ourselves but show us a side of ourselves we weren’t quite able to discern before. Almost like learning who you are through someone else. Even then, Kalman’s work doesn’t tend to fit this simplistic idea. It’s hard to describe this book — if you can even call it that, given it’s equal parts words and art. It’s simply a wonderful journey through Kalman’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart breaks. Someone does and does not go mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?” begins Kalman. As the book proceeds, we’re given a brief history of the extinction of the dodo, informed about the life and fate of various Russian authors (and prominent thinkers), Kalman’s family and their background, about hats, suitcases, and pieces of furniture that Kalman has encountered. This is not, as it may initially seem, some arbitrary collection of information. It is precisely how we encounter life, jumping from thought to thought, place to place, as a means to avoid matters of discomfort, or importance, towards diversions that please us momentarily. Take, for example, the mid-book detour to Paris in order to avoid dealing with philosophy, or more serious and pressing issues such as Nietzsche’s mustache. It is also very funny — something this book does quite well given it tends to discuss war, death, and philosophy, all within a page or two of discussing hats and dodos. It is sometimes incredibly mind-bending realizing how fully aware Kalman is of her environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also, by far, one of the most profound books I’ve read in a long, long while, even with all its deviations and contradictions and thoughtless-thoughts that end up stringing themselves together to form a mirror on our existence. There are questions of life and death, of war, of life in war, and in the gray areas that arise from conflicts between the self and our larger role in the world. At one point, quite clearly irked at having just had a white shirt stained standing somewhere in Tel Aviv, Israel, Kalman poses the question, “Is there room for pettiness during a war?” At another point, she acknowledges that she has “many questions but no patience to think things through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is going forward, and everyone is behind everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finished reading the book, I thought against writing about it, not because I didn’t want to share it with people but mostly because I didn’t think any description I could come up with regards the book would do it any sufficient justice. I finished it, put it aside and, over the next few weeks, occasionally went back to it flicking to a random page and seeing what came up. It was one of these random page-flipping moments that convinced me to write about it. On an otherwise blank white page were two handwritten lines mentioning Freud’s belief that “what we say means something. And must be spoken.” Below it lies a paragraph on Wittgenstein’s humorous counter-belief. but I’ll let you pick up the book for that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
