&lt;p&gt;A mid-year retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the middle of the year it felt like a good time to do a general retrospective on the year so far. The last few months have felt like I&amp;rsquo;m riding a sine wave and I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to figure out a general direction for some things. I wanted to pause and take stock of the year so far. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea when you feel overwhelmed to simply take a step back to catch a breath or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;work&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a new project at work which involved me visiting Melbourne for a few weeks. The work is challenging in that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of room for growth and learning new tools and processes and Melbourne was a really fun city to experience. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get disillusioned by work but I try to remember that there are people that value my work and trust me enough to want to spend all this money on me to send me places on my own to figure stuff out unsupervised! Pretty wild, to be honest. It&amp;rsquo;s good to be reminded every once in a while that your professional responsibility occasionally extends beyond just your own immediate interests. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back in India, the work continues from here and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to learn as much as possible while on this new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the time in Melbourne when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t working (evenings and weekends) I went around eating and drinking and exploring the city. Melbourne is full of art (both street art and museums) and is considered the cultural capital of Australia. It&amp;rsquo;s also a city full of immigrants and massively serious about their coffee and their espresso martinis. The Australian work culture is interesting. For someone who has worked in the US and in India, there is a lot of serious emphasis here on work-life balance and working towards increasing the general quality of life. The US likes to talk about it, India doesn&amp;rsquo;t even talk about it, but Australia (or Melbourne, at least) really seems to follow it. I even had someone tell me the people they were managing had actively rejected promotions and pay-raises so as not to disturb their equilibrium. The biggest thing is that it&amp;rsquo;s not really frowned upon. This is really new for someone coming from the Indian and American context. Oh and everything is super expensive in general because obviously they have a really good healthcare industry and the service industry is well paid. Tipping is not really a practice there, although I did find it prevalent in the touristy parts of the city. All in all, I had some preconceived ideas about Australia that I&amp;rsquo;ve since had to correct and some that were accurate were strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;play&#34;&gt;Play&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a half-year of somewhat surreal experiences. In January, I went down with some friends to Ranthambore National Park over a weekend to see some tigers. We booked as many safaris as we could cover in the weekend (3) while also leaving some time to experience Rajasthani food (mainly Raj Kachori) in the city. We were expecting to see &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; tigers, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; laying around or deep in the jungle somewhere. We were absolutely not expecting to see tigers from up to two or three feet away. We were not expecting to see a tiger stare right at us, drinking water (those muscles!), marking her territory, and casually strolling behind us. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly lucky to spot a tiger, even less to have it walk with you. You&amp;rsquo;re left in awe of the sheer power and grace they exude. We were too lucky and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever experience something like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March I climbed the Nag Tibba summit with two friends. The summit is in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand and is part of the lower Himalayan range. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best weekend treks from Delhi and climbs up to a little over 3k meters (~9,900 ft.). It&amp;rsquo;s actually known to be a winter trek but we went at the tail-end of the winter season. Nearer to the summit on the last 2 km stretch we ran into almost knee-deep snow at some places but it was mostly clear up until then. It was an amazing experience and I&amp;rsquo;m already planning my next trek to Bhrigu Lake for the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;service&#34;&gt;Service&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of Feb my dog, Fluffy, was diagnosed with kidney failure. She passed peacefully on June 20th after a long and amazing fight. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a life-changing experience where we&amp;rsquo;ve all scrambled to work through it together with our differing opinions and aching hearts. To say we&amp;rsquo;ve all grown would be putting it mildly. But it is comforting to think that even in her last days she was in good spirits and walking around the house for 2-3 hours a day almost daily. Gratitude and love have taken on new meanings and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to some friends who helped through the process and would inquire about her regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her passing also kind of opened me up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/keeping-count/&#34;&gt;writing again&lt;/a&gt; but it also got me thinking about service again. Teju Cole mentioned in a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://harvardmagazine.com/2019/05/commencement-teju-cole&#34;&gt;commencement speech&lt;/a&gt; the need to use our privilege in service of others. He says, &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip; expertise is not the destination,&amp;rsquo; he cautioned. &amp;lsquo;The destination is freedom. What can we do to free others? Sure, we are experts, but under what ethical pressures does this function? In other words, how do we become a door for others to pass through?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; I like this idea of working towards freedom. Naval Ravikant also echoes this sentiment on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fs.blog/naval-ravikant/&#34;&gt;Knowledge Project podcast&lt;/a&gt; in a way in saying that as he&amp;rsquo;s grown older he wants &lt;em&gt;freedom from&lt;/em&gt; things instead of &lt;em&gt;freedom to&lt;/em&gt; do things. I hope to do more in the line of service this year - either by giving my time or my resources towards things I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;m just grateful that where this year has taken, it has also given. Sometimes you lose someone you love and it feels, momentarily, like the world is a bit darker and you&amp;rsquo;ve lost a companion. But there is also gratitude for the moments you did get to spend together. I think of all the surreal experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had this year and wonder if anything can top the feeling of climbing a mountain, or having a tiger mere feet away from you in all her grace and power, or the feeling of being given responsibility as the true validation that your work does matter and that your opinions do hold weight. It&amp;rsquo;s been a rather eventful and bittersweet half of the year. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping for more and more depth in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Habits</title>
      <link>https://akzn.me/blog/building-habits/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://akzn.me/blog/building-habits/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been really interested in learning about the best models for building and sticking to habits. Part of this is of course stimulated by my own desire to improve and change some of my habits. Over the last five or six years I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to build some habits into my routine to the point that they don&amp;rsquo;t require any effort anymore (reading daily) and miserably failed at some others (working out regularly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my series of learning something new every week (another habit I&amp;rsquo;m trying to build), I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about different models for cultivating better habits/routines. This can apply fairly broadly to anything one wants to implement into their daily routine but in my case it&amp;rsquo;s driven by wanting to be more productive with my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also used a lot of apps and productivity/habit tools and these, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe, are at best support systems and not something you can completely rely on. They&amp;rsquo;re nice to mark a checkbox at the end of the day or keep your &amp;ldquo;habit chain&amp;rdquo; from breaking but they&amp;rsquo;re not actually going to get you to the gym. That part is still on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to a model I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about, particularly because I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself doing something similar naturally. I learned about this model while reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. It boils down essentially to this simple yet revealing diagram drawn by researchers at MIT -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;218&amp;rdquo;]&lt;img src=&#34;https://akzn.me/blog/building-habits/images/Habitloop.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt; The Habit Loop[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
Simply put, in order to change habits -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the routine first and foremost
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, what&amp;rsquo;s leading to it, what is the result, how you feel at the end, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a suitable reward for when you perform the right/new/better habit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rewards are like drugs - nice and helpful drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinpoint the triggers (cues) that lead to the old habit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are the instinctive moments/actions/ circumstances etc. that lead you into the old routine. Identify these but don&amp;rsquo;t fight them just yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an alternative plan when those triggers take place
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea is not to remove the trigger but to replace the routine set off by that trigger with a new and better routine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine being so alone, so helpless that you&amp;rsquo;re stuck in the middle-divider of a busy road on an electric wheelchair with your batteries bust? I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even picture something like this happening until I saw it happen to someone today. It rattled me a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the time of our lives that we spend on growing and building our community and then we go out alone. On my way back from work I cross a four lane road that, around office rush-hour time, is bumper to bumper traffic. Bad enough that cars frequently spill into the box trying to make it past the traffic lights. There&amp;rsquo;s only about ten seconds of a walk signal on this crossing. It&amp;rsquo;s not bad, can be done easily enough even if all you&amp;rsquo;ve got are jello-legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, though, while walking up to the intersection, I saw an old man on one of those electric wheelchairs stuck in the middle of the road fiddling with the controls on the right handle. Initially I just glanced at him and didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much heed (the limits of our attention, right?). It really only struck me that there was even a problem when I was already halfway through crossing the road and the guy still hadn&amp;rsquo;t moved, was still fiddling with the controls. (There&amp;rsquo;s a fairly decent-sized divider in the middle of the road so he wasn&amp;rsquo;t literally on the road or in danger.) Since I was crossing from the other side, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d cross back and help him out (that darned ten second timer) but when I got to his side there was already a student who, having crossed up to the same point as the old man and mid-way having noticed his immobility, asked him if there was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1048&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignright&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;265&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kalman11.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://akzn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kalman11.png?w=226&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a page from Maira Kalman&amp;amp;rsquo;s The Principles of Uncertainty&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Maira Kalman - The Principles of Uncertainty[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there was. I watched from the other end &amp;ndash; though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear them over the traffic &amp;ndash; and I saw the old man, obviously feeling embarrassed, denying the offer of help as if it was just a simple thing he could brush off any minute. Like someone just made a mistake and soon things would be fine. Like the wheelchair was just playing games on him. Not a problem. But we drop all our walls when we honestly need, and want, genuine help. I&amp;rsquo;m glad the guy stuck around despite the old man initially declining his offer. He wheeled him over in the next ten second interval as I stood on the other side, the angst-ridden equivalent of helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, safer and what seemed to be a little bit relaxed, the man continued to fiddle with his controls, not acknowledging our presence. We didn&amp;rsquo;t mind. Life is hard enough. We stood around for a while unsure as to the extent of our responsibility. I asked eventually if we could call him a cab, but he refused. The student asked him if he could call someone who could pick him up. He refused. We looked at each other. Was there even someone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually asked if it would work, foolishly hoping for some kind of emergency-battery mechanism or something to prevent exactly these situations. Now searching through the cords for something under the seat, he said it would. Confident, short answers. After a few minutes and a few remarks from the old man that he was fine, and obviously otherwise being of very little help, we decided to leave. What can you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked away a little heartbroken, a little disappointed that for all the money and all our information and all the apps and all the people around on the busiest street in town, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a man home, couldn&amp;rsquo;t get him to safely cross the road with dignity and without fear - without that thought that will now remain etched in his mind as he whizzes around - that someday his wheelchair might run out of juice, a wheel might get caught in a pothole (happened as he was pushed across road) or it might just flat-out breakdown. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s happened before. How else was he so sure it would work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned around after a few steps to check if he was still there but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Just a Little More Comfortable</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was sitting during the commencement waiting for the proceedings to begin I remembered a statement made by one of my professors a few years ago. It was a motivator for us to consciously appreciate the environment we were in during his class and, roughly paraphrased, it was this: Never again, after having graduated from here, will you be able to replicate the environment you&amp;rsquo;re in today, where there are countless others like you, with similar ideas and ambitions, broad and open minds who want to effect changes in the world to make it just a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the one moment when graduation suddenly felt real. You ever feel that it&amp;rsquo;s mostly among the optimists and the dreamers and the do-ers that we, too, feel creative and emboldened? That those who do and discuss larger-than-us ideas make us feel a little more alive? Fill us up a little with a sense of purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be told that numerically such a concentration would be hard to find in the rest of your life is a depressing thought. Couple that with realizing that you&amp;rsquo;re 23 years old and among the oldest few in the room, and all your closest dorm room friends now have to take a flight and a train before they could even knock on your door is a realization too heavy for mid-commencement ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met that professor in my junior year when I took a class on social entrepreneurship that affirmed what I had long felt about myself. I knew then that I wanted to work in the social field somewhere in the long run. What I had lacked until then was the environment where there were others with similar desires and open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right from the start the class was different. The projects mattered because they were real-world projects with real-world consequences and real-world people working on them full-time on some different continent in different countries, and what you did or didn&amp;rsquo;t do during the semester directly affected someone&amp;rsquo;s livelihood. And given that we were working on making our small share of the &amp;lsquo;dent&amp;rsquo; in reducing food wastage (specifically, in Africa), it directly affected someone&amp;rsquo;s survival too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was among the hardest classes I&amp;rsquo;ve taken, not for the number of hours it required but because it challenged us every step of the way to push ourselves beyond our limits. Up until then I had heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;out of the box thinking&amp;rdquo; being tossed around like a ping-pong ball to the extent that it was more likely I&amp;rsquo;d judge someone negatively simply for using that phrase. Semesters would start with professors regurgitating the same phrases, trying to make their classes sound more exciting and, in turn, end up sounding exactly the same. Cue the yawns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, there seemed a buzz in even the most boring classes. Moving on to a new phase of life, I already miss the environment. The late-night debates on world politics while eating cheez-its straight from the box or the unending conversations on how to make the world a better place, there was, in all, a common thread of ambition extending beyond just the self. That to work for something bigger than oneself was not just a good life, it was the essence. This is, for me, one of the reasons I enjoyed college quite a bit in my last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize now that to be able to maintain such a desire requires constant revision of one&amp;rsquo;s own biases &amp;ndash; something one can fall prey to quite easily outside of the company of similar minds. (It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that adults are by far the worst learners. The biases are at their peak.) It is far too easy to blame the &amp;lsquo;system&amp;rsquo; or lose hope in negativity or just sit back in comfort so as not to disrupt the state of things. I find it senseless and devoid of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found people who were willing to discuss bigger things. I found them willing to take on mundane, menial tasks in order to nudge the system just a little. I found passion in people with inspiring and unnerving ambitions, but most importantly I saw that positively working on something, despite their being no fruitful outcome to it, led others to want to help you succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I think about this more and more, wondering what I can do to effect change in my own way now that I&amp;rsquo;ve left this electrifying atmosphere behind, I am reminded of a brilliant point made by the same professor: Let&amp;rsquo;s allow ourselves to rise above the talk and focus simply on making the world just a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
